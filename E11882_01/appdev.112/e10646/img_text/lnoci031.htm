<p>This illustration depicts the hierarchical information returned by <code>OCIDescribeAny()</code>. The information returned appears like an upside down tree. The illustration shows a bunch of boxes laid out like an upside-down tree connected by downward pointing arrows that form the trunk and branches of the tree with the top box (trunk of the tree) labeled "describe handle". Beneath the "describe handle" box and further down the tree trunk is a box labeled "table description". Beneath the "table description" box and further down the tree trunk is a box labeled "columns". Beneath the "columns" box are two boxes (side-by-side) that form the first (fork) two branches of the tree, one box is labeled "column 1" and the other box is labeled "column 2". Beneath the "column 1" box are two boxes (side-by-side) that form the second (fork) branches of the tree, one box is labeled "data type" and the other box is labeled "name". Beneath the "column 2" box there are no branches.</p>
