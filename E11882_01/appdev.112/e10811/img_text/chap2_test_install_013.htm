<p>chap2_install_013.gif shows the Apache Test Page in a browser. A paragraph at the top of the page contains the text:</p>
<p>If you can see this, it means that the installation of the Apache HTTP Server software on this system was successful. You may now add content to this directory and replace this page.</p>
<p>Immediately under this paragraph, separated by a horizontal line is the heading, "Seeing this instead of the website you expected?" Then there is the following paragraph:</p>
<p>This page is here because the site administrator has changed the configuration of this web server. Please contact the person responsible for maintaining this server with questions. The Apache Software Foundation, which wrote the web server software this site administrator is using, has nothing to do with maintaining this site and cannot help resolve configuration issues.</p>
<p>Immediately under this paragraph, separated by another horizontal line are the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>The Apache documentation has been included with this distrubution. (documentation is a hyperlink)</p>
<p>You are free to use the image below on an Apache-powered web server. Thanks for using Apache!</p>
