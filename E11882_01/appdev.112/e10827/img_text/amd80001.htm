<p>The illustration shows the development cycle using module language. The process is divided into two main stages: development and compilation. During development, an Ada application developer creates application source files, and a SQL application developer creates module language procedures. During the compilation phase, the module language procedures are run through the SQL*Module compiler, which produces specification files and host languages generated code. These outputs are put into the Ada compiler, along with the application source files created by the Ada application developer. This generates an Ada runtime library. Using the ORACLE_SQLLIB package, the runtime library and the SQLLIB SQL library are run through the host linker, which generates the application. The application exchanges data with an Oracle8 Server. The server also exchanges compilation and semantic checking with the SQL*Module compiler.</p>
