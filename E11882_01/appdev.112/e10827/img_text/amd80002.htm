<p>The illustration shows the process for using SQL*Module as an interface builder. The process is divided into two main stages: development and compilation. During development, an Ada application developer creates application source files, and a PL/SQL developer creates PL/SQL stored procedures. During the compilation phase, the stored procedures are fed to an Oracle8 server which works with the SQL*Module compiler to derive interface procedures from stored procedures. The SQL*Module compiler produces specification files and host languages generated code. These outputs are put into the Ada compiler, along with the application source files created by the Ada application developer. This generates an Ada runtime library. Using the ORACLE_SQLLIB package, the runtime library and the SQLLIB SQL library are run through the host linker, which generates the application. The application exchanges data with an Oracle8 Server and also provides it with procedure calls.</p>
