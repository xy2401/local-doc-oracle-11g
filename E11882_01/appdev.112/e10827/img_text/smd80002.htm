<p>The illustration shows the development cycle for a precompiler application. In step one, you begin with a source file containing embedded SQL and included files such as SQLCA. In step two, you run these through the Oracle Precompiler and it generates host language program files. In step three you run these program files through a host language compiler to generate object files. In step four, you run the host linker on the object files and the SQL library (SQLLIB) to generate the application. The application exchanges data with the Oracle8 Server. The server also provides syntactic and semantic checking for the precompiler.</p>
