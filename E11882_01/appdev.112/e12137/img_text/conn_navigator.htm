<p>Figure 3-2 shows the Connections Navigator, which is located in the top left-hand corner of JDeveloper. It shows a hierarchical navigation tree, that allows you to view all the objects accessible from a connection. This connection could be to a database, an application server, a UDDI registry, and so on. In this image, the Connections Navigator displays all the objects accessible by connecting to Oracle Database. You can view the structure for the database, the <code>HR</code> schema, and all the objects within the schema.</p>
