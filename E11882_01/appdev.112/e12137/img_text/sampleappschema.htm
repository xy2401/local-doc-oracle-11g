<p>Figure 1-2 illustrates how the JSP pages developed in the JDBC application are related.</p>
<p>The relationship diagram illustrates the possible flows of user activity through the application. The user first accesses the index.jsp page and proceeds to the login.jsp page to log in. The login_action.jsp verifies the user credentials and forwards authenticated users to the employees.jsp page. Depending on the action selected by the user on the employees.jsp page, the user is led to the insert.jsp page, the edit_emp.jsp page, or the delete_action.jsp page. These pages allow the user to insert a new employee record, modify an existing employee record, or delete an existing employee record, respectively.</p>
