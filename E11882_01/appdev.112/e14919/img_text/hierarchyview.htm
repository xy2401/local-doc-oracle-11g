<p>This is a text description of hierarchyview.gif.</p>
<p>This graphic describes the hierarchical view of the supported XML tag elements and their attributes for the rule condition XML schema. The hierarchy begins with the parent element condition, and its child elements object, and, and any (the element and and any appear together). Then the last children elements of the and element are the notany and not elements, which also appear together.</p>
<p>The object element has one attribute called name and a text element for rule conditions, which is not really an element, but more like an attribute.</p>
<p>The and element contains the attributes join, sequence, and equal, and the child element named object, which can occur two or more times.</p>
<p>The any element contains the attributes count, join, sequence, and equal, and the child element named object, which can occur two or more times.</p>
<p>The notany element contains the attributes by, join, and count, and the child element named object, which can occur once or one or more times.</p>
<p>The not element contains the attributes by and join, and the child element named object, which can occur once or one or more times.</p>
<p>Bolded text in this graphic represents elements; unbolded text represents attributes.</p>
<p>An attribute can occur in any order and more than one can be used in any single rule condition.</p>
<p>The element named object represents the repeated attribute name and text element for rule conditions, which occurs where ever the object element appears.</p>
