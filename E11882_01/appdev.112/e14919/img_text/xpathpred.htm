<body>
<p>The image xpathpred.gif shows a portion of a row in a conceptual predicate table with XPath predicates.</p>
<p>There are five columns in the row.</p>
<p>The first column is labeled Rid, for the row identifier.</p>
<p>The second column is labeled G4 (predicate group 4), and it has two subcolumns. The first subcolumn is labeled Op, for operator, and the second subcolumn is labeled RHS, for the constant on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>The third column is labeled G5 (predicate group 5), and it has two subcolumns. The first subcolumn is labeled Op, for operator, and the second subcolumn is labeled Pos, for positional filter.</p>
<p>The fourth column is labeled G6 (predicate group 6), and it has two subcolumns. The first subcolumn is labeled Op, for operator, and the second subcolumn is labeled RHS, for the constant on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>The last column is labeled Sparse Predicate.</p>
<p>The information in the partial row is as follows:</p>
<p>Rid is r1.</p>
<p>G4 operator is equals to (=).</p>
<p>G4 RHS is Koss.</p>
<p>G5 operator is greater than or equal to (&gt;=).</p>
<p>G5 position is 1.</p>
<p>G6 operator is equals to (=).</p>
<p>G6 RHS is 64 MB.</p>
<p>Sparse predicate is <code>extract(...) is not null and ...</code></p>
