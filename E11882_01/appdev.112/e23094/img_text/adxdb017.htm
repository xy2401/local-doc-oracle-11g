<p>This diagram describes the Oracle XML&nbsp;DB architecture. An Oracle Database is shown in the middle. There are four bidirectional arrows connecting the Oracle Database from above. The first arrow at the far left connects the database to a box labeled "Direct HTTP Access". This box connects to the word "Browser" above it with a bidirectional arrow.</p>
<p>The second bidirectional arrow from the left connects the database to a box labeled "Oracle Net Services Access". This box connects to the words "JDBC Application" above it with a bidirectional arrow. The words JDBC Application" connect to a box labeled "Browser or other UI" above it with a bidirectional arrow. A box labeled "Oracle Streams AQ Access" is to the right of the arrow between the database and the box labeled "Oracle Net Services Access". There is an arrow from "Oracle Streams AQ Access" to the arrow between the database and "Oracle Net Services Access"</p>
<p>The third bidirectional arrow from the left connects the database to a box labeled "WebDAV Access". This box connects to the words "Desktop Tool" above it with a bidirectional arrow.</p>
<p>The fourth bidirectional arrow from the left connects the database to a box labeled "FTP Access". This box connects to the words "FTP Tool" above it with a bidirectional arrow.</p>
<p>To the left of the Oracle Database is a bidirectional arrow that connects to a box labeled "Gateways to external sources". Inside the Oracle Database is a dashed box labeled "Oracle XML&nbsp;DB". Inside this dashed box are two boxes. One is labeled "XMLType Tables and Views". The other is labeled "Oracle XML DB Repository". A dashed line connects these two boxes.</p>
<p>The "XMLType Tables and Views box" connects below it with a line to a bulleted list named "XML Services". The bullets are as follows: XML Validation; XML Transformation; XML Schema Registration; Create Tables; Insert, Delete, Update XMLType tables; and Indexing. To the right of the "XML Services" list is a bulleted list named "Retrieve/Generate XML Using XMLType APIs". It has these five bullets: SQL, Java, PL/SQL, C, and C++.</p>
<p>The box labeled "Oracle XML DB Repository" connects below it with a line to another bulleted list named "XML Services". This list has these three bullets: Versioning, ACL Security, and Foldering. Below this is another bulleted list named "Retrieve/Generate XML Using Resource APIs", which has these three bullets: SQL, Java, and PL/SQL.</p>
