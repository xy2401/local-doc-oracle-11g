<p>This graphic illustrates backup-based duplication without a target connection. The RMAN client is at the bottom of the graphic. At the top-right is the Duplicate Database, which resides on the Destination Host. The rectangle to the left of the duplicate database is labeled Auxiliary Instance. The Duplicate Database is connected through an arrow to the RMAN Backups, displayed below the database. At the top-left is the Recovery Catalog Database, which resides on the Recovery Catalog Host. The rectangle labeled Catalog Instance is to the right of the source database. An arrow from the RMAN client to the Duplicate Database, labelled Connect Auxiliary, indicates that RMAN connects to the duplicate database AS AUXILIARY. The arrow from the RMAN client to the Recovery Catalog Database, labelled Connect Catalog, indicates that RMAN connects to the recovery catalog database AS CATALOG.</p>
