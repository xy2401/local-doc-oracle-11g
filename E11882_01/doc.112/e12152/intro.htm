This book is for an old release of SQL Developer. You are encouraged to use the latest available release. See <code><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/</a></code> for information about downloads and documentation.</div>
<p>Oracle SQL Developer is a graphical version of SQL*Plus that gives database developers a convenient way to perform basic tasks. You can browse, create, edit, and delete (drop) database objects; run SQL statements and scripts; edit and debug PL/SQL code; manipulate and export data; and view and create reports.</p>
<p>You can connect to any target Oracle database schema using standard Oracle database authentication. Once connected, you can perform operations on objects in the database.</p>
<p>You can connect to schemas for selected third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, and Microsoft Access, and view metadata and data in these databases; and you can migrate third-party databases to Oracle.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><a id="RPTUG10100"></a>Installing and Getting Started with SQL Developer</h2>
<p>To install and start SQL Developer, you simply download a ZIP file and unzip it into a desired parent directory or folder, and then type a command or double-click a file name. You should read the <a class="olink RPTIG" href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=db112&amp;id=RPTIG"><span class="italic">Oracle Database SQL Developer Installation Guide</span></a> before you perform the installation. After you have read the installation guide, the basic steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unzip the SQL Developer kit into a directory (folder) of your choice. This directory location will be referred to as <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unzipping the SQL Developer kit causes a directory named <code>sqldeveloper</code> to be created under the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code> directory. It also causes many files and folders to be placed in and under that directory.</p>
<p><span class="bold">If Oracle Database (Release 11 or later) is also installed</span>, a version of SQL Developer is also included and is accessible through the menu system under Oracle. This version of SQL Developer is separate from any SQL Developer kit that you download and unzip on your own, so do not confuse the two, and do not unzip a kit over the SQL Developer files that are included with Oracle Database. Suggestion: Create a shortcut for the SQL Developer executable file that you install, and always use it to start SQL Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start SQL Developer, go to the <code>sqldeveloper</code> directory under the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code> directory, and do one of the following:</p>
<p>On Linux and Mac OS X systems, run <span class="italic">sh sqldeveloper.sh</span>.</p>
<p>On Windows systems, double-click <code>sqldeveloper.exe</code>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref16"></a><a id="sthref17"></a><a id="sthref18"></a>If you are asked to enter the full pathname for java.exe, click <span class="bold">Browse</span> and find java.exe. For example, on a Windows system the path might have a name similar to <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\java.exe</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to become familiar with SQL Developer concepts before using the interface, read the rest of this chapter before proceeding to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create at least one database connection (or import some previously exported connections), so that you can view and work with database objects, use the SQL Worksheet, and use other features.</p>
<p>To create a new database connection, right-click the <span class="bold">Connections</span> node in the Connections navigator, select <span class="bold">New Connection</span>, and complete the required entries in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to get started quickly with SQL Developer, do the short tutorial in <a href="tut_library.htm#CBAHDFAF">Chapter 3, "Tutorial: Creating Objects for a Small Database"</a>, or work with your existing database objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="sect1"><a id="sthref19"></a><a id="sthref20"></a><a id="RPTUG10200"></a>SQL Developer User Interface</h2>
<p>The SQL Developer window generally uses the left side for navigation to find and select objects, and the right side to display information about selected objects.</p>
<p><a href="#BABCHFGH">Figure 1-1</a> shows the main window.</p>

<!-- class="figure" -->
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
This text explains the default interface. However, you can customize many aspects of the appearance and behavior of SQL Developer by setting preferences (see <a href="#CHDEDCJD">SQL Developer Preferences</a>). If you ever need to restore the default interface, see <a href="#CHDBHFIA">Restoring the Original "Look and Feel"</a>.</div>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
For migration of third-party databases to Oracle, see also <a href="migration.htm#CHDFHCEH">SQL Developer User Interface for Migration</a>.</div>
<p>The menus at the top contain standard entries, plus entries for features specific to SQL Developer (see <a href="#CHDDHJBA">Menus for SQL Developer</a>), as shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="527" height="46" src="img/ui_top.gif" alt="Top of the window: menus and icons" /><br />
<p><a id="sthref21"></a><a id="sthref22"></a><a id="sthref23"></a>You can use <span class="bold">shortcut keys</span> to access menus and menu items: for example Alt+F for the File menu and Alt+E for the Edit menu; or Alt+H, then Alt+S for Help, then Full Text Search. You can also display the File menu by pressing the F10 key.</p>
<p>Icons under the menus perform various actions, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">New</span> creates a new a new database object (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBBDCB">Create/Edit New Object (New Gallery)</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open</span> opens a file (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACCGAAG">Open File</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Save</span> saves any changes to the currently selected object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Save All</span> saves any changes to all open objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Back</span> moves to the pane that you most recently visited. (Or use the drop-down arrow to specify a tab view.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Forward</span> moves to the pane after the current one in the list of visited panes. (Or use the drop-down arrow to specify a tab view.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Open SQL Worksheet</span> opens the SQL Worksheet (see <a href="#CHDDHAAI">Using the SQL Worksheet</a>). If you do not use the drop-down arrow to specify the database connection to use, you are asked to select a connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The left side of the SQL Developer window has tabs and panes for the Connections and Reports navigators, icons for performing actions, and a hierarchical tree display for the currently selected navigator, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="229" height="220" src="img/ui_left.gif" alt="Left side of window: navigation" /><br />
<p>The <span class="bold">Connections navigator</span> lists database connections that have been created. To create a new database connection, import an XML file with connection definitions, or export or edit current connections, right-click the Connections node and select the appropriate menu item. (For more information, see <a href="#CHDHIFGJ">Database Connections</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="sthref24"></a>The <span class="bold">Files navigator</span> (marked by a folder icon; not shown in the preceding figure) displays your local file system using a standard hierarchy of folders and files. You can double-click or drag and drop files to open them, and you can edit and save the files. For example, if you open a .sql file, it is displayed in a SQL Worksheet window. The Files navigator is especially useful if you are using versioning with SQL Developer (see <a href="#CHDIICEH">Using Versioning</a>).</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Reports navigator</span> lists informative reports provided by SQL Developer, such as a list of tables without primary keys for each database connection, as well as any user-defined reports. (For more information, see <a href="#CHDBJIBJ">SQL Developer Reports</a>.)</p>
<p>Icons under the Connections tab (above the metadata tree) perform the following actions on the currently selected object:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> queries the database for the current details about the selected object (for example, a connection or just a table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref25"></a><a id="sthref26"></a><a id="sthref27"></a>Apply Filter</span> restricts the display of objects using a filter that you specify. For example, you can right-click the Tables node and specify a filter of EM% to see only tables that start with <span class="italic">EM</span> and to have the Tables node label be changed to <span class="italic">Tables (EM%)</span>. To remove the effects of applying a filter, right-click the node and select <span class="bold">Clear Filter</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The metadata tree in the Connections pane displays all the objects (categorized by object type) accessible to the defined connections. To select an object, expand the appropriate tree node or nodes, then click the object.</p>
<p>The right side of the SQL Developer window has tabs and panes for objects that you select or open, as shown in the following figure, which displays information about a table named BOOKS. (If you hold the mouse pointer over the tab label -- BOOKS in this figure -- a tooltip displays the object's owner and the database connection.)</p>
<img width="394" height="194" src="img/ui_right.gif" alt="Right side of the window: details about selected objects" /><br />
<p>For objects other than subprograms, icons provide the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> <a id="sthref28"></a><a id="sthref29"></a>(the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that object's tab and information in the window when you click another object in the Connections navigator; a separate tab and display are created for that other object. If you click the pin again, the object's display is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Edit</span> displays a dialog box for editing the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Refresh</span> updates the display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Actions</span> displays a menu with actions appropriate for the object. The actions are the same as when you right-click an object of that type in the Connections navigator, except the Actions menu does not include Edit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To switch among objects, click the desired tabs; to close a tab, click the X in the tab. If you make changes to an object and click the X, you are asked if you want to save the changes.</p>
<p>For tables and views, this information is grouped under tabs, which are labeled near the top. For example, for tables the tabs are Columns, Data (for seeing and modifying the data itself), Indexes, Constraints, and so on; and you can click a column heading under a tab to sort the grid rows by the values in that column. For most objects, the tabs include SQL, which displays the SQL statement for creating the object.</p>
<p>You can export data from a detail pane or from the results of a SQL Worksheet operation or a report by using the context menu and selecting <span class="bold">Export</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Messages - Log</span> area is used for feedback information as appropriate (for example, results of an action, or error or warning messages). If this area is not already visible, you can display is by clicking View and then Log.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Compiler - Log</span> area is used for any messages displayed as a result of a Compile or Compile for Debug operation.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref47"></a>Restoring the Original "Look and Feel"</h3>
<p>If you have made changes to the SQL Developer user interface ("look and feel"), such as accidentally repositioning navigators and panes, you can restore the interface to the way it was after SQL Developer was installed by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are running SQL Developer, exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a backup copy of the folder or directory where your SQL Developer user information is stored, in case you want to restore any old user-defined reports, snippets, code templates, or SQL history. The default location is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<span class="italic">&lt;user-name&gt;</span>\Application Data\SQL Developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux or Mac OS X: ~/.sqldeveloper</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have specified a nondefault location for your SQL Developer user information (see <a href="#CIHFCGCD">Location of User-Related Information</a>), create the backup copy of that folder or directory instead.</p>
<p>(If you do not want to use any old information or settings, you can skip creating a backup copy.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the original (not the backup) folder or directory where your user information is stored (explained in step 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start SQL Developer.</p>
<p>This creates a folder or directory where your user information is stored (explained in step 2), which has the same content as when SQL Developer was installed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A database link is a database object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database. The other database need not be an Oracle Database system; however, to access non-Oracle systems you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services. After you have created a database link, you can use it to refer to tables and views in the other database. The Connections navigator has a <span class="bold">Database Links</span> node for all database links (public and private) owned by the user associated with the specified connection, and a <span class="bold">Public Database Links</span> node for all public database links on the database associated with the connection.

<p>A directory object specifies an alias for a directory (called a folder on Windows systems) on the server file system where external binary file LOBs (BFILEs) and external table data are located. To create a directory (that is, a directory object), you can use SQL Developer or the SQL statement CREATE DIRECTORY.</p>
<p>You can use directory names when referring to BFILEs in your PL/SQL code and OCI calls, rather than hard coding the operating system path name, for management flexibility. All directories are created in a single namespace and are not owned by an individual schema. You can secure access to the BFILEs stored within the directory structure by granting object privileges on the directories to specific users.</p>

<p>A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. The FROM clause of the query can name tables, views, and other materialized views. Collectively these objects are called master tables (a replication term) or detail tables (a data warehousing term). This reference uses "master tables" for consistency. The databases containing the master tables are called the master databases.

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref79"></a>Materialized View Logs</h3>
<p>A materialized view log is a table associated with the master table of a materialized view. When DML changes are made to master table data, Oracle Database stores rows describing those changes in the materialized view log and then uses the materialized view log to refresh materialized views based on the master table. This process is called incremental or fast refresh. Without a materialized view log, Oracle Database must reexecute the materialized view query to refresh the materialized view. This process is called a complete refresh. Usually, a fast refresh takes less time than a complete refresh.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><a id="sthref140"></a><a id="sthref141"></a><a id="RPTUG10400"></a>Database Connections</h2>
<p>A <span class="bold">connection</span> is a SQL Developer object that specifies the necessary information for connecting to a specific database as a specific user of that database. You must have at least one database connection (existing, created, or imported) to use SQL Developer.</p>
<p>You can connect to any target Oracle database schema using standard Oracle database authentication. Once connected, you can perform operations on objects in the database. You can also connect to schemas for selected third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, and Microsoft Access, and view metadata and data.</p>
<p><a id="sthref142"></a>When you start SQL Developer and whenever you display the database connections dialog box, SQL Developer automatically reads any connections defined in the tnsnames.ora file on your system, if that file exists. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory, but it can also be in the directory specified by the TNS_ADMIN environment variable or registry value or (on Linux systems) the global configuration directory. On Windows systems, if the tnsnames.ora file exists but its connections are not being used by SQL Developer, define TNS_ADMIN as a system environment variable. For information about the tnsnames.ora file, see the "Local Naming Parameters (tnsnames.ora)" chapter in <span class="italic">Oracle Database Net Services Reference</span>.</p>
<p>You can create additional connections (for example, to connect to the same database but as different users, or to connect to different databases). Each database connection is listed in the Connections navigator hierarchy.</p>
<p>To create a new database connection, right-click the Connections node and select <span class="bold">New Database Connection</span>. Use the dialog box to specify information about the connection (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a>). You can also create a new database connection by selecting an existing connection in that dialog box, changing the connection name, changing other connection attributes as needed, and clicking Save or Connect.</p>
<p>To edit the information about an existing database connection, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Properties</span>. Use the dialog box to modify information about the connection, but do not change the connection name. (See <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a>.)</p>
<p>To organize connection groups using folders, see <a href="#CHDJDGIJ">Using Folders to Group Connections</a>.</p>
<p>To export information about the existing database connections into an XML file that you can later use for importing connections, right-click Connections in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Export Connections</span>. Use the dialog box to specify the connections to be exported (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBDDIA">Export/Import Connection Descriptors</a>).</p>
<p>To import connections that had previously been exported (adding them to any connections that may already exist in SQL Developer), right-click Connections in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Import Connections</span>. Use the dialog box to specify the connections to be imported (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACBDDIA">Export/Import Connection Descriptors</a>).</p>
<p>To perform limited database management operations if you are connected AS SYSDBA, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Manage Database</span>. You can click to refresh the read-only display of memory (SGA and PGA) and tablespace information. If a listener is running with a static listener configured for the database, you can also click to start and stop the database.</p>
<p>To perform remote debugging if you are using the Sun Microsystem's Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) and you would like the debugger to listen so that a debuggee can attach to the debugger, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Remote Debug</span>. Use the dialog box to specify remote debugging information (see <a href="dialogs.htm#BACHGIHJ">Debugger - Attach to JPDA</a>).</p>
<p><a id="sthref143"></a><a id="sthref144"></a><a id="sthref145"></a>To estimate or compute statistics for objects in a database schema, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Gather Schema Statistics</span>.

<p><a id="sthref146"></a><a id="sthref147"></a><a id="sthref148"></a>To generate documentation (in HTML format (comparable to Javadoc for Java classes) about a schema, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Generate DB Doc</span>. To view the generated documentation, open the index.html file in the output directory that you specified.</p>
<p>To rename a connection, right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Rename Connection</span>.</p>
<p>To delete a connection (that is, delete it from SQL Developer, <span class="italic">not</span> merely disconnect from the current connection), right-click the connection name in the Connections navigator display and select <span class="bold">Delete</span>. Deleting a connection does not delete the user associated with that connection.</p>
<p>To connect using an existing connection, expand its node in the Connections navigator, or right-click its name and select <span class="bold">Connect</span>. A SQL Worksheet window is also opened for the connection (see <a href="#CHDDHAAI">Using the SQL Worksheet</a>). <a id="sthref149"></a><a id="sthref150"></a><a id="sthref151"></a>To create a separate unshared worksheet for a connection, use Ctrl+Shift+N.</p>
<p>To disconnect from the current connection, right-click its name in the Connections navigator and select <span class="bold">Disconnect</span>.</p>
<p>To specify a preference for using an OCI (thick, Type 2) driver (if available) instead of a JDBC (thin) driver for basic and TNS (network alias) database connections, enable the <span class="bold">Use OCI/Thick driver</span> option under the <a href="#CHDFGCAC">Database: Advanced Parameters</a> user preferences.</p>

<p>You can use folders in the Connections navigator to organize connections into groups: for example, one folder for connections on your local system, another for connections on the test system, and another for connections on the production system.</p>
<p>To create a folder to hold connections, right-click the name in the Connections navigator of a connection to be added to the folder, select <span class="bold">Add to Folder</span> and then <span class="bold">New Folder</span>, and specify the folder name (such as Local Connections).</p>
<p>To add more connections to a folder, right-click the name in the Connections navigator of a connection to be added to the folder, and select <span class="bold">Add to Folder</span> and then the name of the folder into which to add the connection.</p>
<p>To move a connection from one folder to another folder, right-click the connection name under its current folder, select <span class="bold">Add to Folder</span>, and then either the name of the destination folder or <span class="bold">New Folder</span> to move the connection to a new folder to be created.</p>
<p>To remove a connection from the folder, right-click the connection name under the folder and select <span class="bold">Remove from Folder</span>. (This does <span class="italic">not</span> delete the connection; it is moved to the top level in the Connections navigator hierarchy display.)</p>
<p>To remove a folder, right-click the folder name select <span class="bold">Remove Folder</span>. (This does <span class="italic">not</span> delete any connections that are in the folder; these connections are moved to the top level in the Connections navigator hierarchy display.)</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Sharing of Connections</h3>
<p>By default, each connection in SQL Developer is shared when possible. For example, if you open a table in the Connections navigator and two SQL Worksheets using the same connection, all three panes use one shared connection to the database. In this example, a commit operation in one SQL Worksheet commits across all three panes. If you want a dedicated session, you must duplicate your connection and give it another name. Sessions are shared by name, not connection information, so this new connection will be kept separate from the original.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to use Oracle Advanced Security to secure a JDBC connection to the database. Both the JDBC OCI and the JDBC Thin drivers support at least some of the Oracle Advanced Security features.

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref157"></a><a id="sthref158"></a>Connections with Proxy Authentication</h3>
<p>Proxy authentication enables one JDBC connection to act as a proxy for other JDBC connections. If you use the Proxy Connection option when you create a database connection, the connection will be used to connect as the specified user for the connection, but authenticated using the user name and either the password or distinguished name of the proxy user. For information about using a middle tier server for proxy authentication, see <span class="italic">Oracle Database Security Guide</span>.</p>
<p>For example, to create connection for a user named PROXY_USER but connecting using the user name and password of existing database user SCOTT, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create the proxy user and grant it the appropriate privileges:</p>
<pre>
CREATE USER proxy_user IDENTIFIED BY &lt;password&gt;;
ALTER USER proxy_user GRANT CONNECT THROUGH scott AUTHENTICATED USING PASSWORD;
GRANT create session TO proxy_user;
. . .&lt;Grant other privileges as needed.&gt;
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Create a new database connection. For example: connection name = proxy_conn, user name = scott, password = <span class="italic">&lt;password for scott&gt;</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable (check) <span class="bold">Proxy Connection</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Oracle Proxy Connection dialog box, select <span class="bold">User Name</span> for Proxy Type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Proxy User, enter <span class="bold">PROXY_USER</span>; and for Proxy Password, enter the password for the PROXY_USER database user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK to close the Oracle Proxy Connection dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any other necessary connection information, and click Connect to create the connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, when you connect using the proxy_conn connection, the user name and password for user SCOTT are used to connect to the database, but the connection sees the database objects owned by the PROXY_USER schema.</p>

<p>You can use SQL Developer to run and debug PL/SQL subprograms (functions and procedures).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To run a subprogram, click its name in the Connections navigator; then either right-click and select Run, or click the Edit icon and then click the Run icon above its source listing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To debug a subprogram, click its name in the Connections navigator. If the procedure in its current form has not already been compiled for debug, right-click and select Compile for Debug. Then click the Edit icon and click the Debug icon above its source listing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, a code editing window is displayed. The following figure shows the code editing window being used to debug a procedure named LIST_A_RATING2, which is used for tutorial purposes in <a href="tut_library.htm#CBACAEJG">Debug a PL/SQL Procedure</a>.</p>
<img width="669" height="428" src="img/debugging.gif" alt="Interface for debugging a PL/SQL subprogram" /><br />
<p>In the code editing window, under the tab with the name of the subprogram, is a toolbar, and beneath it is the text of the subprogram, which you can edit. You can set and unset breakpoints for debugging by clicking to the left of the thin vertical line beside each statement with which you want to associate a breakpoint. (When a breakpoint is set, a red circle is displayed.)</p>
<p>The toolbar under the tab for the subprogram name has a toolbar that includes the icons shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="107" height="24" src="img/source_tab_toolbar.gif" alt="Source tab toolbar icons" /><br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run</span> starts normal execution of the subprogram, and displays the results in the <span class="bold">Running - Log</span> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Debug</span> starts execution of the subprogram in debug mode, and displays the <span class="bold">Debugging - Log</span> tab, which includes the debugging toolbar for controlling the execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Compile</span> performs a PL/SQL compilation of the subprogram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Compile for Debug</span> performs a PL/SQL compilation of the subprogram so that it can be debugged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="bold">Debugging - Log</span> tab under the code text area contains the debugging toolbar and informational messages. The debugging toolbar has the icons shown in the following figure.</p>
<img width="189" height="23" src="img/debugging_toolbar.gif" alt="Debugging toolbar icons" /><br />
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Find Execution Point</span> goes to the execution point (the next line of source code to be executed by the debugger).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Over</span> bypasses the next subprogram (unless the subprogram has a breakpoint) and goes to the next statement after the subprogram. If the execution point is located on a subprogram call, it runs that subprogram without stopping (instead of stepping into it), then positions the execution point on the statement that follows the call. If the execution point is located on the last statement of a subprogram, Step Over returns from the subprogram, placing the execution point on the line of code that follows the call to the subprogram from which you are returning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Into</span> executes a single program statement at a time. If the execution point is located on a call to a subprogram, Step Into steps into that subprogram and places the execution point on its first statement. If the execution point is located on the last statement of a subprogram, Step Into returns from the subprogram, placing the execution point on the line of code that follows the call to the subprogram from which you are returning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step Out</span> leaves the current subprogram and goes to the next statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Step to End of Method</span> goes to the last statement of the current subprogram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Resume</span> continues execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Pause</span> halts execution but does not exit, thus allowing you to resume execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Terminate</span> halts and exits the execution. You cannot resume execution from this point; instead, to start running or debugging from the beginning of the subprogram, click the Run or Debug icon in the Source tab toolbar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="bold">Breakpoints</span> tab displays breakpoints, both system-defined and user-defined.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Smart Data</span> tab displays information about variables, using your <a href="#CHDBADII">Debugger: Smart Data</a> preferences. You can also specify these preferences by right-clicking in the Smart Data window and selecting <span class="bold">Preferences</span>.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref172"></a><a id="sthref173"></a>Remote Debugging</h3>
<p>To debug a function or procedure for a connection where the database is on a different host than the one on which you are running SQL Developer, you can perform remote debugging. Remote debugging involves many of the steps as for local debugging; however, do the following before you start the remote debugging:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use an Oracle client such as SQL*Plus to issue the debugger connection command. Whatever client you use, make sure that the session which issues the debugger connection commands is the same session which executes your PL/SQL program containing the breakpoints. For example, if the name of the remote system is remote1, use the following SQL*Plus command to open a TCP/IP connection to that system and the port for the JDWP session:</p>
<pre>
EXEC DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP.CONNECT_TCP('remote1', '4000');
</pre>
<p>The first parameter is the IP address or host name of the remote system, and the second parameter is the port number on that remote system on which the debugger is listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the connection for the remote database, select <span class="bold">Remote Debug</span>, and complete the information in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACHGIHJ">Debugger - Attach to JPDA</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, follow the steps that you would for local debugging (for example, see <a href="tut_library.htm#CBACAEJG">Debug a PL/SQL Procedure</a>).</p>

<p>If you have any SQL Trace (.trc) output files, you can display them in SQL Developer as an alternative to using the TKPROF program to format the contents of the trace file. To open a .trc file in SQL Developer and see an attractive, effective display of the information, click <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Open</span>, and specify the file; or drag the file's name or icon into the SQL Developer window.</p>
<p>You can then examine the information in the List View, Statistics View, and History panes, with each pane including options for filtering and controlling the display.</p>

<p>For an Oracle Database Release 11.1 or later connection, you can use the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler to identify bottlenecks and performance-tuning opportunities in PL/SQL applications. Profiling consists of the two steps: running the PL/SQL module in profiling mode, and analyzing the reports. In addition, some one-time setup work is required the first time you use profiling in SQL Developer.</p>
<p>To initiate profiling, right-click the name of the function or procedure in the Connections navigator hierarchy and select <span class="bold">Profile</span>, or click the Profile button on the PL/SQL source editor toolbar. After the function or procedure is run in profiling mode, the profiler reports are located at the Execution Profiles tab of the object viewer window. You can review subprogram-level execution summary information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of calls to the subprogram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent in the subprogram itself (function time or self time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time spent in the subprogram itself and in its descendent subprograms (subtree time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed parent-children information, including all subprograms that a given subprogram called (that is, children of the given subprogram)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about using the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler, see <a class="olink ADFNS023" href="../../appdev.112/e41502/adfns_profiler.htm#ADFNS023"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Advanced Application Developer's Guide</span></a>.</p>

<p>A watch enables you to monitor the changing values of variables or expressions as your program runs. After you enter a watch expression, the Watches window displays the current value of the expression. As your program runs, the value of the watch changes as your program updates the values of the variables in the watch expression.</p>
<p>A watch evaluates an expression according to the current context which is controlled by the selection in the Stack window. If you move to a new context, the expression is reevaluated for the new context. If the execution point moves to a location where any of the variables in the watch expression are undefined, the entire watch expression becomes undefined. If the execution point returns to a location where the watch expression can be evaluated, the Watches window again displays the value of the watch expression.</p>
<p>To open the Watches window, click <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">Debugger</span>, then <span class="bold">Watches</span>.</p>
<p>To add a watch, right-click in the Watches window and select <span class="bold">Add Watch</span>. To edit a watch, right-click in the Watches window and select <span class="bold">Edit Watch</span>.</p>

<p>The script runner emulates a limited set of SQL*Plus features. You can often enter SQL and SQL*Plus statements and execute them by clicking the <span class="bold">Run Script</span> icon. The Script Output pane displays the output.</p>
<p><a id="sthref192"></a>The SQL*Plus features available in the script runner include @, @@, CONNECT, EXIT, QUIT, UNDEFINE, WHENEVER, and substitution variables. For example, to run a script named c:\myscripts\mytest.sql, type @c:\myscripts\mytest in the Enter SQL Statement box, and click the drop-down next to the Execute Statement icon and select Run Script.</p>
<p>The following considerations apply to using the SQL Developer script runner:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot use bind variables. (The Execute SQL Statement feature does let you use bind variables of type VARCHAR2, NUMBER, and DATE.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For substitution variables, the syntax &amp;&amp;variable assigns a permanent variable value, and the syntax &amp;variable assigns a temporary (not stored) variable value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For EXIT and QUIT, commit is the default behavior, but you can specify rollback. In either case, the context is reset: for example, WHENEVER command information and substitution variable values are cleared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DESCRIBE works for most, but not all, object types for which it is supported in SQL*Plus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For SQL*Plus commands that are not supported, a warning message is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL*Plus comments are ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For XMLType data, data in the column is displayed as "SYS.XMLDATA" if the database connection uses a JDBC Thin driver, but the expanded XML values are displayed if the connection uses an OCI (thick, Type 2) driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have SQL*Plus available on your system, you may want to use it instead of the script runner.</p>

<p>The Execute Explain Plan icon generates the execution plan, which you can see by clicking the Explain tab. The execution plan is the sequence of operations that will be performed to execute the statement. An execution plan shows a row source tree with the hierarchy of operations that make up the statement. For each operation, it shows the ordering of the tables referenced by the statement, access method for each table mentioned in the statement, join method for tables affected by join operations in the statement, and data operations such as filter, sort, or aggregation.</p>
<p>In addition to the row source tree, the plan table displays information about optimization (such as the cost and cardinality of each operation), partitioning (such as the set of accessed partitions), and parallel execution (such as the distribution method of join inputs).

Most of the specific information displayed is determined by the <a href="#CHDEDCJD">SQL Developer Preferences</a> for <a href="#CHDIJCCC">Database: Autotrace Parameters</a>. If you cancel a long-running statement, partial execution statistics are displayed.</p>
<p>This information can help you to identify SQL statements that will benefit from tuning. For example, you may be able to optimize predicate handling by transitively adding predicates, rewriting predicates using Boolean algebra principles, moving predicates around in the execution plan, and so on.

<p>You can use graphical gauges to display query results in the SQL Worksheet and in user-defined reports. In both cases, you need to specify the name of the value column for the gauge data, and minimum and maximum values on the gauge, and the values to be shown as low and high on the gauge (usually between the minimum and maximum values). In the SQL Worksheet, the required structure for the value to be selected is:</p>
<p>'SQLDEV:GAUGE:&lt;min&gt;:&lt;max&gt;:&lt;low&gt;:&lt;high&gt;:' || &lt;value-column&gt;</p>
<p>For example, to display the last name and the salary in gauge format, where the gauge shows from 1000 to 30000 with below 10000 as low and above 18000 as high, for employees with ID numbers less than a number to be specified, connect to the supplied HR schema and execute the following query:</p>
<pre>
SELECT last_name, 'SQLDEV:GAUGE:1000:30000:10000:18000:' || salary 
  FROM employees WHERE employee_id &lt; :employee_id
</pre>
<p>If you specify 104 as the bind variable value, the output appears as shown in the following figure:</p>
<img width="409" height="144" src="img/gauge_worksheet.gif" alt="Gauge display of preceding query" /><br />
<p>For a user-defined gauge report, the query must specify only the value column, the minimum and maximum values, and the low and high values, and optionally a WHERE clause. The required structure for the query (before any optional WHERE clause) is:</p>
<p>SELECT &lt;value-column&gt;, &lt;min&gt;, &lt;max&gt;, &lt;low&gt;, &lt;high&gt; FROM &lt;table-name&gt;</p>
<p>For example, to create a report of salaries in gauge dial format, with the same values and WHERE clause as in the preceding query, right-click on User Defined Reports in the Reports navigator and select <span class="bold">Add Report</span>. In the Add Report dialog box, specify a report name; for <span class="bold">Style</span>, select <span class="bold">Gauge</span>; and for <span class="bold">SQL</span>, enter the following:</p>
<pre>
SELECT salary, 1000, 30000, 10000, 18000 FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id &lt; :EMPLOYEE_ID;
</pre>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Chart Details</span> tab near the bottom of the box; for <span class="bold">Chart Type</span>, select DIAL; for <span class="bold">Query Based</span>, select true; and click <span class="bold">Apply</span>.</p>
<p>Use the Reports navigator to view the newly created user-defined report. For <span class="bold">Connection</span>, specify one that connects to the HR sample schema. For the bind variable value, specify 104. The report shows four semicircular dials, each with a label containing the salary amount and a "needle" pointing to an appropriate place on the dial.</p>

<p>Snippets are code fragments, such as SQL functions, Optimizer hints, and miscellaneous PL/SQL programming techniques. Some snippets are just syntax, and others are examples. You can insert and edit snippets when you are using the SQL Worksheet or creating or editing a PL/SQL function or procedure.</p>
<p>To display snippets, from the <span class="bold">View</span> menu, select <span class="bold">Snippets</span>. In the snippets window (on the right side), use the drop-down to select a group (such as Aggregate Functions or Character Functions). In most cases, the fragments in each group do not represent all available objects in that logical grouping, or all formats and options of each fragment shown. For complete and detailed information, see the Oracle Database documentation.</p>
<p>A <span class="bold">Snippets</span> button is placed in the right window margin, so that you can display the snippets window if it becomes hidden.</p>
<p>To insert a snippet into your code in a SQL Worksheet or in a PL/SQL function or procedure, drag the snippet from the snippets window and drop it into the desired place in your code; then edit the syntax so that the SQL function is valid in the current context. To see a brief description of a SQL function in a tooltip, hold the pointer over the function name.</p>
<p>For example, you could type SELECT and then drag CONCAT(char1, char2) from the Character Functions group. Then, edit the CONCAT function syntax and type the rest of the statement, such as in the following:</p>
<pre>
SELECT CONCAT(title, ' is a book in the library.') FROM books;
</pre>

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref205"></a><a id="sthref206"></a><a id="RPTUG10910"></a>User-Defined Snippets</h3>
<p>You can create and edit snippets. User-defined snippets are intended mainly to enable you to supplement the Oracle-supplied snippets, although you are also permitted to replace an Oracle-supplied snippet with your own version.</p>
<p>When you create a user-defined snippet, you can add it to one of the Oracle-supplied snippet categories (such as Aggregate Functions) or to a category that you create. If you add a snippet to an Oracle-supplied category and if your snippet has the same name as an existing snippet, your snippet definition replaces the existing one. (If you later upgrade to a new version of SQL Developer and if you choose to preserve your old settings, your old user-defined snippets will replace any Oracle-supplied snippets of the same name in the new version of SQL Developer.)</p>
<p>To create a snippet, do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open the Snippets window and click the <span class="bold">Add User Snippets</span> icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select text for the snippet in the SQL Worksheet window, right-click, and select <span class="bold">Save Snippet</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">Add User Snippet</span> icon in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACJJDDF">Edit Snippets (User-Defined)</a> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To edit an existing user-defined snippet, click the <span class="bold">Edit User Snippets</span> icon in the Snippets window.</p>
<p>Information about user-defined snippets is stored in a file named UserSnippets.xml under the directory for user-specific information. For information about the location of this information, see <a href="#CIHFCGCD">Location of User-Related Information</a>.</p>

<p>SQL Developer provides integrated support for the following versioning and source control systems: CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion. The SQL Developer documentation does not provide detailed information about the concepts and operations of such systems; it assumes that you know them or can read about them in the product documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the CVS manual (by Per Cederqvist and others), see <code><a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/">http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For information about Subversion, see <code><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a></code>. For Subversion documentation, see <code><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a></code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To access the versioning features of SQL Developer, use the <a href="#CHDEIHEA">Versioning menu</a>.</p>
<p>If you create any versioning system repositories, you can use the hierarchical display in the Files navigator, which is marked by a folder icon. (If that navigator is not visible, click <span class="bold">View</span>, then <span class="bold">Files</span>.)</p>
<a id="CHDJHBFH"></a>
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2">About CVS and SQL Developer</h3>
<p>CVS repositories can be created on a local PC or remote server. There can be more than one CVS repository. You need to create one or more CVS repositories.</p>
<p>Source files are held in a CVS repository. The source files in a CVS repository are grouped into modules. If you have new files, a wizard in SQL Developer will help you import them into the CVS repository and place them under version control. A copy is made of your original files and placed in a subdirectory (.backup) of the one from which you imported them.</p>
<p>Files to be worked on are checked out from the CVS repository. This makes a local copy of the files. You can see the contents of the CVS repository in the SQL Developer CVS Navigator and open read-only versions of files. You can then decide which files you want to check out and work on.</p>
<p>CVS creates a new directory populated with the copy of the source files. You can see the files in the System Navigator. You can also open them from here.</p>
<p>Source files have a status, depending on what operations have been carried out on them. A preference lets you choose whether the version control status of a file is shown in the System Navigator.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref217"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Pending Changes (CVS)</h4>
<p>The Pending Changes window is displayed if you click Versioning, then CVS, then Pending Changes, or when you initiate an action that changes the local source control status of a file. This window shows files that have been added, modified or removed (locally or remotely), files whose content conflicts with other versions of the same file files that have not been added to source control files that are being watched, and files for which editors have been obtained. You can use this information to detect conflicts and to resolve them where possible.</p>
<p>The Outgoing pane shows changes made locally, the Incoming pane shows changes made remotely, and the Candidates pane shows files that have been created locally but not yet added to source control. You can double-click file names to edit them, and you can use the context menu to perform available operations.</p>

<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2">About Subversion and SQL Developer</h3>
<p>Before you can work with a Subversion repository through SQL Developer, you must create a connection to it. When you create a local Subversion repository, a connection to it is automatically created, and this can be seen in the Subversion Navigator. You can subsequently edit the connection details.</p>
<p>Existing files must be imported into the Subversion repository to bring them under version control. Files are then checked out from the Subversion repository to a local folder known as the "Subversion working copy". Files created in (or moved into) SQL Developer must be stored in the Subversion working copy.</p>
<p>Files newly created within SQL Developer must be added to version control. Changed and new files are made available to other users by committing them to the SQL Developer repository. The Subversion working copy can be updated with the contents of the Subversion repository to incorporate changes made by other users.</p>

<p>SQL Developer provides many reports about the database and its objects. You can also create your own user-defined reports. To display reports, click the Reports tab on the left side of the window (see <a href="#BHAHIFGB">SQL Developer User Interface</a>). If this tab is not visible, select <span class="bold">View</span> and then <span class="bold">Reports</span>.</p>
<p>Individual reports are displayed in tabbed panes on the right side of the window; and for each report, you can select (in a drop-down control) the database connection for which to display the report. For reports about objects, the objects shown are only those visible to the database user associated with the selected database connection, and the rows are usually ordered by Owner. The detail display pane for a report includes the following icons at the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze View</span> <a id="sthref220"></a><a id="sthref221"></a>(the <span class="bold">pin</span>) keeps that report in the SQL Developer window when you click another report in the Reports navigator; a separate tab and detail view pane are created for that other report. If you click the pin again, the report's detail view pane is available for reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run Report</span> updates the detail view pane display by querying the database for the latest information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Run Report in SQL Worksheet</span> displays the SQL statement used to retrieve the information for a report in a SQL Worksheet pane, where you can view, edit, and run the statement (see <a href="#CHDDHAAI">Using the SQL Worksheet</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The time required to display specific reports will vary, and may be affected by the number and complexity of objects involved, and by the speed of the network connection to the database.</p>
<p>For most reports that contain names of database objects, you can double-click the object name in the report display pane (or right-click the object name and select Go To) to display that object in a detail view pane, just as if you had selected that object using the Connections navigator.</p>
<p><a id="sthref222"></a><a id="sthref223"></a><a id="sthref224"></a><a id="sthref225"></a>To export a report into an XML file that can be imported later, right-click the report name in the Reports navigator display and select <span class="bold">Export</span>. To import a report that had previously been exported, select the name of the report folder name (such as a user-defined folder) in which to store the imported report, right-click, and select <span class="bold">Import</span>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref226"></a><a id="sthref227"></a>You can create a <span class="bold">shared report</span> from an exported report by clicking Tools, then Preferences, and using the <a href="#CHDIHFJA">Database: User-Defined Extensions</a> pane to add a row with Type as REPORT and Location specifying the exported XML file. The next time you restart SQL Developer, the Reports navigator will have a Shared Reports folder containing that report.</p>
<p>Reports are grouped in the following categories:</p>
<p><a href="#CHDJDDHJ">About Your Database reports</a> list release information about the database associated with the connection.</p>

<p><a href="#CHDEDDBE">XML reports</a> list information about XML objects.</p>
<p><a href="#CHDGGBDG">User Defined reports</a> are any customized reports that you have created.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref228"></a>Bind Variables for Reports</p>
<p><a id="sthref229"></a><a id="sthref230"></a>For some reports, you are prompted for <span class="bold">bind variables</span> before the report is generated. These bind variables enable you to further restrict the output. The default value for all bind variables is null, which implies no further restrictions. To specify a bind variable, select the variable name and type an entry in the Value field. Any bind variable values that you enter are case insensitive, all matches are returned where the value string appears anywhere in the name of the relevant object type.</p>

<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDDBJIB"></a>Quality Assurance reports</p>
<p>Quality assurance reports are table reports that identify conditions that are not technically errors, but that usually indicate flaws in the database design. These flaws can result in various problems, such as logic errors and the need for additional application coding to work around the errors, as well as poor performance with queries at run time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables without Primary Keys</span>: Lists tables that do not have a primary key defined. A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Although tables are not required to have a primary key, it is strongly recommended that you create or designate a primary key for each table. Primary key columns are indexed, which enhances performance with queries, and they are required to be unique and not null, providing some "automatic" validation of input data. Primary keys can also be used with foreign keys to provide referential integrity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables without Indexes</span>: Lists tables that do not have any indexes. If a column in a table has an index defined on it, queries that use the column are usually much faster and more efficient than if there is no index on the column, especially if there are many rows in the table and many different data values in the column.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Tables with Unindexed Foreign Keys</span>: Lists any foreign keys that do not have an associated index. A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) that references a primary key: that is, each value in the foreign key must match a value in its associated primary key. Foreign key columns are often joined in queries, and an index usually improves performance significantly for queries that use a column. If an unindexed foreign key is used in queries, you may be able to improve run-time performance by creating an index on that foreign key.</p>

order by 1
</pre>
<p>The preceding query lists the last name and salary of each employee in each department, grouping the results by department ID (10, 20, 30, ... 110). Note that the expected syntax for the SQL statement for a chart report is:</p>
<pre>
SELECT <span class="italic">&lt;group&gt;</span>,<span class="italic">&lt;series&gt;</span>,<span class="italic">&lt;value&gt;</span> FROM <span class="italic">&lt;table(s)&gt;</span>

<p><span class="bold">Ignore Whitespace</span>: If this option is enabled, leading and trailing tabs and letter spacing are ignored when comparing files. Carriage returns are not ignored. Enabling this option makes comparing two files easier when you have replaced all the space with hard tabs, or vice versa. Otherwise, every line in the two documents might be shown as different in the Compare window.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Show Character Differences</span>: If this option is enabled, characters that are present in one file and not in another are highlighted. Red highlighting indicates a character that has been removed. Green highlighting indicates a character that has been added. The highlighting is shown only when you click into a comparison block that contains character differences.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable XML Compare</span>: If this option is enabled, XML files can be compared.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable XML Merge</span>: If this option is enabled, XML files can be merged.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Reformat Result</span>: If this option is enabled, merged XML files can be reformatted.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Validate Result (May require Internet access)</span>: If this option is enabled, merged XML files will be validated.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDBHDCC"></a>Comparing Source Files</p>
<p>You can compare source files in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A file currently being edited with its saved version: Place the focus on the current version open in the editor, then select the History tab in the editor window. The saved file opens side by side with the file in the editor buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One file with another file outside the project: Place the focus on the file in the editor to be compared; from the main menu, choose <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Compare With Other File</span>; in the Select File to Compare With dialog, navigate to the file and click Open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two files within the same project: In the navigator, select the two files to be compared; then from the main menu, choose <span class="bold">File</span>, then <span class="bold">Compare With Each Other</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Third Party JDBC Drivers pane specifies drivers to be used for connections to third-party (non-Oracle) databases, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Sybase Adaptive Server. (You do not need to add a driver for connections to Microsoft Access databases.) To add a driver, click <span class="bold">Add Entry</span> and select the path for the driver (for example, a file with a name similar to <code>mysql-connector-java-5.0.4-bin.jar</code>, in a directory under the one into which you unzipped the download for the MySQL driver; or <code>jtds-1.2.jar</code>, which is included in the <code>jtds-1.2-dist.zip</code> download, for Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server).</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Alternative:</p>
As an alternative to using this preference, you can click <span class="bold">Help</span>, then <span class="bold">Check for Updates</span> to install the JTDS JDBC Driver for Microsoft SQL Server and the MySQL JDBE Driver as extensions.</div>
<p>To find a specific third-party JDBC driver, see the appropriate Web site (for example, <code><a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a></code> for the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver for MySQL, or <code><a href="http://jtds.sourceforge.net/">http://jtds.sourceforge.net/</a></code> for the jTDS driver for Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server). For MySQL, use the MySQL 5.0 driver, not 5.1 or later, with SQL Developer release 1.5.</p>
<p>You must specify a third-party JDBC driver or install a driver using the Check for Updates feature before you can create a database connection to a third-party database of that associated type. (See the tabs for creating connections to third-party databases in the <a href="dialogs.htm#BACICJAF">Create/Edit/Select Database Connection</a> dialog box.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">Default Repository</span>: Migration repository to be used for storing the captured models and converted models. For information about migrating third-party databases to Oracle, including how to create a migration repository, see <a href="migration.htm#CHDECEIA">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref319"></a><a id="sthref320"></a>Migration: Data Move Options</p>
<p>The Data Move Options pane contains options that affect the behavior when you migrate data from third-party databases to Oracle Database tables generated by the migration.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Online for all. Offline for MySQL, SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server:</span> Options that can be used for online data migration for all supported third-party databases, and for offline data migration for MySQL, SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Representation for 0 Length String</span>: The value to which Oracle converts zero-length strings in the source data. Can be a space (' ') or a null value (NULL). Specific notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Microsoft Access offline migrations, a null value and a space are considered the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Sybase offline migrations, '' is considered the same as a space (' ').</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For MySQL offline migrations, a null value is exported as 'NULL', which is handled as type VARCHAR2. You can specify another escape character by using the --fields-escaped-by option with the mysqldump command (for example, specifying <code>\N</code> for null or <code>\\</code> for \). For information about the mysqldump command, see <a href="migration.htm#CHDDDCBC">Creating Data Files From MySQL</a>.</p>
<p>For MySQL offline migrations, the data is exported to a file named <span class="italic">table-name</span>.txt; so if you are moving data from two or more tables with the same name but in different schemas, rename files as needed so that they are all unique, and modify the SQL*Loader .ctl file accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Online</span>: The online data move options determine the results of files created when you click <span class="bold">Migration</span>, then <span class="bold">Migrate Data</span>.</p>
<p><a id="sthref321"></a><a id="sthref322"></a><span class="bold">Number of Parallel Data Move Streams</span>: The number of internal connections created for simultaneous movement of data from the source database to the Oracle tables. Higher values may shorten the total time required, but will use more database resources during that time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Number of Rows to Commit After</span>: During the data move operation, Oracle pauses to perform an automatic internal commit operation after each number of rows that you specify are moved from the source database to Oracle tables.</p>
<p>Lower values will cause a successful move operation to take more time; but if a failure occurs, it is likely that more source records will exist in the Oracle tables and that if the move operation is resumed, fewer source records will need to be moved. Higher values will cause a successful move operation to take less time; but if a failure occurs, it is likely that fewer source records will exist in the Oracle tables and that is the move operation is resumed, more source records will need to be moved.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Offline</span>: The offline data move options determine the results of files created when you click <span class="bold">Migration</span>, then <span class="bold">Generate Scripts</span>, then <span class="bold">Generate Data Move Scripts</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Offline Data Script Directory</span>: Default location for scripts for offline data move operations.</p>

<p>The Generation Options pane contains options that determine the results of files created when you click <span class="bold">Migration</span>, then <span class="bold">Generate Scripts</span>, then <span class="bold">Generate Oracle DDL</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">One single file</span>, <span class="bold">A file per object</span>, or <span class="bold">A file per database</span>: Determines how many files are created and their relative sizes. Having more files created might be less convenient, but may allow more flexibility with complex migration scenarios. (See also the Maximum Number of Lines option.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Output Directory</span>: Default location in which the files will be created.</p>
<p>I<span class="bold">mplement 'CREATE' as 'CREATE OR REPLACE'</span>: Causes CREATE statements in source database objects to be implemented using CREATE OR REPLACE when the Oracle syntax allows this.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generate Comments</span>: Generates comments in the Oracle SQL statements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Generate Controlling Script</span>: Generates a "master" script for running all the required files.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Maximum Number of Lines</span>: Sets a maximum number of lines for each file; you then specify the number.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref323"></a>Least Privilege Schema Migration</span>: For migrating schema objects in a converted model to Oracle, causes CREATE USER, GRANT, and CONNECT statements <span class="italic">not</span> to be generated in the output scripts. You must then ensure that the scripts are run using a connection with sufficient privileges. You can select this option if the database user and connection that you want to use to run the scripts already exist, or if you plan to create them.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref324"></a><a id="sthref325"></a>Generate Data Move User</span>: For data move operations, creates an additional database user with extra privileges to perform the operation. It is recommended that you delete this user after the operation. This option is provided for convenience, and is suggested unless you want to perform least privilege migrations or unless you want to grant privileges manually to a user for the data move operations. This option is especially recommended for multischema migrations, such as when not all tables belong to a single user.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref326"></a><a id="sthref327"></a>Generate Failed Objects</span>: Causes objects that failed to be converted to be included in the generation script, so that you can make any desired changes and then run the script. If this option is not checked, objects that failed to be converted are not included in the generation script.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><a id="sthref328"></a><a id="sthref329"></a>Generate Stored Procedure for Migrate Blobs Offline</span>: Causes a stored procedure named CLOBtoBLOB_sqldeveloper (with execute access granted to public) to be created if the schema contains a BLOB (binary large object); this procedure is automatically called if you perform an offline capture. If this option is not checked, you will need to use the manual workaround described in <a href="migration.htm#CHDEAJCE">Populating the Destination Database Using the Data Files</a>. (After the offline capture, you can delete the CLOBtoBLOB_sqldeveloper procedure or remove execute access from public.)</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="CHDCBDAC"></a>Migration: Identifier Options</p>
<p>The Identifier Options pane contains options that apply to object identifiers during migrations.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Prepended to All Identifier Names</span> (Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server migrations only): A string to be added at the beginning of the name of migrated objects. For example, if you specify the string as XYZ_, and if a source table is named EMPLOYEES, the migrated table will be named XYZ_EMPLOYEES. (Be aware of any object name length restrictions if you use this option.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Is Quoted Identifier On</span> (Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase Adaptive Server migrations only): If this option is enabled, quotation marks (double-quotes) can be used to refer to identifiers (for example, SELECT "Col 1" from "Table 1"); if this option is not enabled, quotation marks identify string literals. <span class="bold">Important</span>: The setting of this option must match the setting in the source database to be migrated, as explained in <a href="migration.htm#i1005806">Before Migrating From Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref330"></a>Migration: Translation Options</p>
<p>The Translation Options pane contains options that relate to conversion of stored procedures and functions from their source database format to Oracle format.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="sthref332"></a>Versioning</h3>
<p>Versioning preferences affect the behavior of the version control and management systems that you can use with SQL Developer. You can specify preferences for CVS and Subversion. For information about using versioning with SQL Developer, see <a href="#CHDIICEH">Using Versioning</a>.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref333"></a><a id="sthref334"></a>Versioning: CVS</p>
<p>The CVS pane specifies options for use with CVS (Concurrent Versions System).</p>
<p><span class="bold">CVS Client</span>: <span class="bold">Internal to Oracle SQL Developer</span> (installed with SQL Developer) or <span class="bold">External Executable</span> (separately installed CVS client, for which you must specify the name or path).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Name on System Path</span>: Name of the CVS server executable. The default (cvs) is correct for most installations. This option assumes that the name of the CVS server executable is on the system path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Path from Environment</span>: Location of the CVS server executable, especially if there is more than one on the system path. The selection area will list all instances of the CVS server executable known to the local system. You may have more than one version of CVS installed: this option lets you specify which of them to use with SQL Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Other Path</span>: Location of the CVS server executable, if it is not on the system path at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Run CVS in Edit/Watch Mode</span>: If this option is enabled, you coordinate access to files by declaring an editor for them through CVS, after which they may be modified. Only those files that you check out after changing this preference will be affected. If this option is disabled, the edit and watch commands on the Versioning menu are disabled.</p>
<p><span class="bold">State Overlay Scheme</span>: Scheme for the icons displayed alongside folder and file names in the navigators to indicate their versioning status.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref335"></a>Versioning: CVS: Commands</p>
<p>The CVS: Commands pane sets options for CVS source control. Some options are not available when using the internal CVS client.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Enable Advanced Controls</span>: If this option is enabled, advanced CVS controls are shown in dialog boxes. If you find that you use only basic CVS features, you might wish to use SQL Developer without advanced controls, to reduce complexity and save screen space.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Run Quietly</span>: If this option is enabled, informational messages are suppressed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Do not Log Commands</span>: If this option is enabled, CVS commands are not logged in the repository command history.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Global Options: Encrypt</span>: If this option is enabled, all communication between the client and the server is encrypted. Encryption support is not available in CVS by default; it must be enabled using a special configuration option when you build CVS.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Set Compression Level (z)</span>: If this option is enabled, you can set the compression level for files sent between client and server. The level can be set from Minimum (high speed, low compression) to Maximum (low speed, high compression).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword Substitution Mode</span>: CVS uses keyword substitution modes to insert revision information into files when they are checked out or updated. This option controls the mode of replacement for keyword substitution in versioned files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Automatic</span>: The default, recommended option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Only Mode</span>: Generates only keyword names in keyword strings and omits their values. This option is useful for disregarding differences due to keyword substitution when comparing different revisions of a file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Value Mode</span>: Generates keyword strings using the default form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Keyword-Value-Locker Mode</span>: Like the keyword-value mode, except that the name of the locker is always inserted if the given revision is currently locked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Old-Contents Mode</span>: Generates the old keyword string, present in the working file just before it was checked in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Value-Only Mode</span>: Generates only keyword values for keyword strings. This can help generate files in programming languages where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters from a string. However, further keyword substitution cannot be performed once the keyword names are removed, so this option should be used with care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">On Commit: Use Comment Templates</span>: If this option is enabled, your commit comments will be entered through template forms. The forms are set up by the CVS system administrator. There may be different forms for different circumstances and installations, and it may be that none of them are suitable for your commit comments. In this case, this preference lets you disable the use of all forms.</p>
<p><span class="bold">On Commit: Automatically Add Files</span>: If this option is enabled, local files are added to the CVS repository whenever you perform a commit action.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Create Backup Files on Remove</span>: If this option is enabled, backup copies are made of files that are removed through actions of the source control system.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref336"></a>Versioning: CVS: General</p>
<p>The CVS: General pane specifies environment settings and the operation timeout.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Navigator State Overlay Icons</span>: If this option is enabled, state overlay icons are used. State overlay icons are small symbols associated with object names in the navigators. They indicate the state of version-controlled files (for example, "up to date").</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Navigator State Overlay Labels</span>: If this option is enabled, state overlay labels are used. State overlay labels are tooltips associated with object names in the navigators.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Automatically Make Files Editable</span>: If this option is enabled, an editor is automatically used on a data file when you start to change it. (If you edit a file unintentionally, immediately use Versioning, then Unedit to revert.)</p>
<p><span class="bold">Operation Timeout</span>: Maximum time allowed for CVS operations to complete.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref337"></a>Versioning: CVS: Navigator Labels</p>
<p>The CVS: Navigator Labels pane specifies formatting for CVS information appears on navigator nodes and tool tips. For a full explanation of keyword substitution modes, see the CVS documentation.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref338"></a>Versioning: CVS: Version Tools</p>
<p>The CVS: Version Tools pane specifies options for the pending changes window and the merge editor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Outgoing Changes Commit Dialog</span>: Enables you to make optimum use of limited screen space when the Pending Changes window is open. You can save screen space by not showing the Comments area of the Pending Changes window, but you might still want to add comments before a commit action. You can choose the circumstances under which the Commit dialog is opened: always, only when the Comments area of the Pending Changes window is hidden, or never.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Incoming Changes Timer Interval</span>: The frequency at which the change status of files is checked.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Merge Editor</span>: Specifies whether files are merged locally or at the server.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref339"></a><a id="sthref340"></a>Versioning: Subversion</p>
<p>The Subversion pane specifies the Subversion client to use with SQL Developer.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref341"></a>Versioning: Subversion: General</p>
<p>The Subversion: General pane specifies environment settings and the operation timeout.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Use Navigator State Overlay Icons</span>: If this option is enabled, state overlay icons are used. State overlay icons are small symbols associated with object names in the navigators. They indicate the state of version-controlled files (for example, "up to date").</p>

<p>SQL Developer stores user-related information in several places, with the specific location depending on the operating system and certain environment specifications. User-related information includes user-defined reports, user-defined snippets, SQL Worksheet history, code templates, and SQL Developer user preferences. In most cases, your user-related information is stored outside the SQL Developer installation directory hierarchy, so that it is preserved if you delete that directory and install a new version.</p>
<p>The user-related information is stored in or under the following location:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Windows systems: the <code>HOME</code> environment variable location, if defined; otherwise the <code>SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR</code> location, if defined; otherwise as indicated in the following table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Linux and Mac OS X systems: the <code>SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR</code> location, if defined; otherwise as indicated in the following table</p>

<p>To specify a nondefault <code>SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR</code> location, do either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set the <code>SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR</code> environment variable to specify another directory path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">&lt;sqldeveloper_install&gt;</span></code><code>\sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\bin\sqldeveloper.conf</code> file and substitute the desired directory path for <code>SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR</code> in the following line:</p>
<pre>
SetUserHomeVariable SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to prevent other users from accessing your user-specific SQL Developer information, you must ensure that the appropriate permissions are set on the directory where that information is stored or on a directory above it in the path hierarchy. For example, on a Windows system you may want to ensure that the <code>SQL Developer</code> folder and the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">\&lt;user-name&gt;\Application Data\SQL Developer</span></code> folder under <code>Documents and Settings</code> are not shareable; and on a Linux or Mac OS X system you may want to ensure that the <code>~/.sqldeveloper</code> directory is not world-readable.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><a id="sthref348"></a><a id="sthref349"></a><a id="RPTUG11300"></a>Using the Help</h2>
<p>SQL Developer provides a Help menu and context-sensitive help (click the Help button or press the F1 key in certain contexts). Much of the help content is also in <span class="italic">Oracle Database SQL Developer User's Guide</span>, which is in the SQL Developer Documentation Library.</p>
<p>Help is displayed in the Help Center window, which has a Contents pane on the left, a Search box at the top right, and a help topic display pane under the Search box. You can move the horizontal divider to change the pane sizes (for example, to make the Contents pane narrower, to allow more room for the help topic content). You can also resize and reposition the Help Center window.</p>
<p>For Search, you can click the icon (binoculars) to see search options: case sensitive (Match case) or case insensitive; and whether to match topics based on all specified words, any specified words, or a Boolean expression.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Keep on Top</span> button toggles whether the Help Center window is kept on top of the display when you switch focus (click) back in the SQL Developer window.</p>
<p>To print a help topic, display it in the topic display pane and click the Print icon at the top of the pane.</p>
<p><a id="sthref350"></a><a id="sthref351"></a><a id="sthref352"></a>To increase or decrease the size of the font in the help topic viewer, click the Change Font Size (A) icon in the Help Center topic display area toolbar, then select Increase Font Size of Decrease Font Size. This setting is preserved only for the duration of the current help pane or window; therefore, you may want to keep the Help Center window open after setting the help text font to your preferred size.</p>
