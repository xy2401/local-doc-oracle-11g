<p>Shows Data Mining Process Overview. This shows two major areas, Oracle Database and BIEE Reports. In the Oracle Database, there are processes in OADM_SYS schema to support mining, including these: Mining Support Tables that feed into the Mining Package, and Mining Source Views that also feed into the Mining Package. The Mining Source Views are from the OADM Main Model and from Mining ETL. The Mining Package produces Mining Result Tables that are source for the BIEE Reports.
