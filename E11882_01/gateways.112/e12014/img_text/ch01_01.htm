<body>
<p>This is a text description of Figure&nbsp;1-1, "The Gateway Architecture".</p>
<p>This illustration of the gateway architecture is adequately described in the "Architecture" section of the chapter, which is presented before the figure.</p>
<p>The Client is shown connecting to an Oracle database by means of Oracle Net or by means of a local connection.</p>
<p>The Oracle database connects to the gateway instance (Oracle Database Gateway for DRDA) by means of Oracle Net or by means of local connections (or by one of each - any combination is possible).</p>
<p>The gateway instance connects through the network to the DRDA server.</p>
<p>The purpose of this figure is to show that the Oracle Database Gateway for DRDA can connect an Oracle database to a non-Oracle database. Connection options include Oracle Net, local connections, and TCP/IP links.</p>
