<body>
<p>The figure illustrates the connection pool load balancing feature. A client requests a connection from the connection cache. The connection pool load balancing mechanism selects the connection that belongs to the best instance from the connection cache, in this case, either Instance1 or Instance2. The client receives the connection that would process the work request with the best response time.</p>
