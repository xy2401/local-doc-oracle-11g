<p>This process flow diagram describes how labels are evaluated for read access with COMPACCESS privilege. There are three successive tests in which a label may be evaluated for read access when the user has COMPACCESS privilege:<span class="bold">Test 1</span>: Levels. Is the data level equal to or less than the user level? <span class="bold">No</span>. Access is denied. <span class="bold">Yes</span>. Proceed to Test 2.<span class="bold">Test 2</span>: Groups. Does the data have groups? <span class="bold">No</span>. Proceed to Test 3, Case A. <span class="bold">Yes</span>. Does the user have at least one group? If <span class="bold">no</span>, proceed to Test 3, Case B. If <span class="bold">yes</span>, proceed to Test 3, Case A.<span class="bold">Test 3</span>: Compartments. Does the data have compartments? <span class="bold">Case A</span>. <span class="bold">No</span>. Access is granted. <span class="bold">Yes</span>. Does the user have all the compartments? If <span class="bold">no</span>, access is denied. If <span class="bold">yes</span>, access is granted. <span class="bold">Case B</span>. <span class="bold">No</span>. Access is denied. <span class="bold">Yes</span>. Does the user have all the compartments? If <span class="bold">no</span>, access is denied. If <span class="bold">yes</span>, access is granted.</p>
