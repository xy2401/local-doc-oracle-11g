<p>Label Evaluation Process for Write Access with COMPACCESS Privilege and Inverse Groups: This flow diagram illustrates the criteria that must be satisfied to gain write access with inverse groups. Failing any criterion prohibits access. Criteria: 1. The data level must be less than or equal to the user level. 2. The data level must be greater than or equal to the user minimum level. 3. If the user has groups, then the data must have all the groups that are in the user label, and the user's max_write groups must be a superset of the groups in the data label, and the data must have no compartments or, if it has compartments, the user has write access on all the compartments. 4. If the user does not have groups but the data has groups, then all but one of the requirements of criterion (3) apply. The one that does not apply is that the data have all groups in the user label. All the other requirements of criterion (3) apply. 5. If the user does not have groups and the data does not have groups, then the data must have no compartments or, if it has compartments, the user must have write access on all the compartments. 6. If the user has groups but the data does not have all the groups that are in the user label, then the data must have compartments and the user must have write access on all the compartments. Failing any of these criteria causes denial of access. In all other conditions, access is granted.</p>
