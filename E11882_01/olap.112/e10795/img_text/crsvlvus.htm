<p>This is a text description of crsvlvus.gif. This figure illustrates the relationship between a Source and two Cursor objects created to display different graphical view of the values that the Source specifies. At the bottom of the figure is a Source named querySource. The figure illustrates that a CursorManagerSpecification named queryCMS is created for querySource. A CursorManager named queryCM is created for the queryCMS. From the queryCM, two Cursor objects are created, tableCursor and graphCursor. From tableCursor an object that represents a view, named tableView, is created. From graphCursor, an object named graphView is created. Above tableView is a representation of a table, labeled Table View, and above graphView is a representation of a bar graph, labeled Bar Graph View.</p>
