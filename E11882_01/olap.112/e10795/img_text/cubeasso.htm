<p>This is a text representation of cubeasso.gif. This figure shows the associations between an MdmCube and AWCubeOrganization, CubeMap, MdmMeasure, and MdmDimensionality objects. An MdmCube has a one AWCubeOrganization that it creates with the findOrCreateAWCubeOrganization method. An AWCubeOrganization has one MdmCube. An MdmCube has from zero to many CubeMap objects that it creates with the findOrCreateCubeMap method. A CubeMap has one MdmCube. An MdmCube has from zero to many MdmBaseMeasure and MdmDerivedMeasure objects that it creates with the findOrCreateBaseMeasure and findOrCreateDerivedMeasure methods. An MdmBaseMeasure or MdmDerivedMeasure has one MdmCube. An MdmCube adds MdmDimensionality objects with the addDimension method. An MdmDimensionality has one MdmDimension. An MdmCube specifies a ConsistentSolveSpecification with the setConsistentSolveSpecification method. A ConsistentSolveSpecification has from one to many ConsistentSolveCommand objects.</p>
