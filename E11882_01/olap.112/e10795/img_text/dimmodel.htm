<p>This is a text representation of dimmodel.gif. This figure shows the associations between the classes that implement the dimensional data model. An MdmCube has from zero to many MdmPrimaryDimension objects and it owns from zero to many MdmMeasure objects. An MdmMeasure is owned by one MdmCube object. An MdmPrimaryDimension has from zero to many MdmCube objects and it owns from one to many MdmDimensionLevel objects, from one to many MdmHierarchy objects, and from zero to many MdmAttribute objects. MdmDimensionLevel, MdmHierarchy, and MdmAttribute objects are owned by one MdmPrimaryDimension.</p>
