<h1 class="chapter"><span class="secnum">12</span> Deploying to Target Schemas and Executing ETL Logic</h1>
<p>Oracle Warehouse Builder provides functionality that supports a single logical model and multiple physical models. It enables you to design your data warehouse and implement this design on multiple target systems. In addition, Oracle Warehouse Builder supports multiple physically different implementations of the same object definitions.</p>
<p>This chapter describes the implementation environment in Oracle Warehouse Builder. It also describes how to deploy objects and run ETL logic.</p>
<p>This chapter contains the following topics:</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Overview of Deployment and Execution in Oracle Warehouse Builder</h2>
<p>After you design your data warehouse, you must implement this design in the target schema by deploying and executing design objects. The Control Center Manager offers a comprehensive deployment console that enables you to view and manage all aspects of deployment and execution. It provides access to the information stored in the active Control Center.</p>
<a id="i1074893"></a>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">About <a id="sthref1424"></a>Deployment</h3>
<p>Deployment is the process of creating physical objects in a target location according to the logical objects defined in Oracle Warehouse Builder workspace. The data objects created when you designed the target schema and defined ETL objects are logical definitions. Oracle Warehouse Builder stores the metadata for these data objects in the workspace. To create these objects physically in the target schema, you must deploy these objects. For example, when you create a table using the Design Center, the metadata for this table is stored in the workspace. To physically create this table in the target schema, you must deploy this table to the target schema.</p>
<p>As part of the deployment process, Oracle Warehouse Builder validates and generates the scripts for the object, transfers the scripts to the Control Center, and then invokes the scripts against the deployment action associated with the object. You can deploy an object from the Projects Navigator or using the Control Center Manager.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Whenever you deploy an object, Oracle Warehouse Builder automatically saves all changes to all design objects to the workspace. You can display a warning message by selecting <span class="bold">Prompt for commit</span> on the Preferences dialog box.</div>
<p>You can deploy only those objects for which you have the <code>COMPILE</code> privilege. By default, you have this privilege on all objects in the workspace. However, the workspace owner may have instituted a different security policy.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Always maintain objects using Oracle Warehouse Builder. Do not modify the deployed, physical objects manually in SQL. Otherwise, the logical objects and the physical objects are not synchronized, which may cause unpredictable results.</div>
<a id="BABHDBGE"></a>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3">About Deployment <a id="sthref1425"></a><a id="sthref1426"></a>Actions</h4>
<p>As soon as you define a new object in the Design Center, the object is listed in the Control Center Manager under its deployment location. Each object has a default deployment action, which you can display. The default deployment action for an object is based on a comparison of its current design status to its current deployment status. For example, a table that has not been previously deployed, has a default deployment action of Create. A table that was previously deployed, has a default action of Upgrade. You can override the default by choosing a different deployment action in the Control Center Manager.</p>
<p>The default is set by the previous action and varies depending on the type of object.</p>
<p>These are the deployment actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Create</span>: Creates the object in the target location. If an object with that name exists, then an error may result. For example, this may happen if the object has not been previously deployed from Oracle Warehouse Builder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Upgrade</span>: Modifies the object without losing data, if possible. You cannot undo or redo an upgrade action. This action is not available for some object types, such as schedules.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
When you use the Control Center to upgrade a table that contains a <code>ROW MOVEMENT</code> clause in its DDL script, the upgrade fails.
<p>To solve this problem, before you deploy the table using an Upgrade action, set the Row Movement configuration parameter of the table to NULL and then deploy the table.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Drop</span>: Deletes the object from the target location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Replace</span>: Deletes and re-creates the object. This action is quicker than Upgrade, but it deletes all data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><a id="sthref1427"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">About Deployment <a id="sthref1428"></a>Status</h4>
<p>After you deploy an object, Oracle Warehouse Builder assigns a deployment status to it. The status represents the result of the deployment. You can view the deployment status in the Control Center Manager.</p>
<p>The deployment status can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Not Deployed:</span> Indicates that the object has not yet been deployed to the target schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Success:</span> Indicates that the object has been successfully deployed to the target schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Warning:</span> Indicates that some warnings were generated during the deployment of the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Failed:</span> Indicates that deployment of the object failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="sect3">About Deploying Dimensional Objects</h4>
<p>To deploy MOLAP dimensional objects, ensure that the version of the location and the PL/SQL Generation Mode configuration parameter of the Oracle module are set. The location version must be at least 11gR1, and the configuration parameter PL/SQL Generation Mode must be either default, 11<span class="italic">g</span> Release 1 or higher to generate 11<span class="italic">g</span> AWs that support cube organized MVs.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref1429"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">About Deploying Mappings and Process Flows</h4>
<p>ETL objects include mappings and process flows. Deploying a mapping or process flow includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generate the PL/SQL, SQL*Loader, or ABAP script, if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register the required locations and deploy any required connectors. This ensures that the details of the physical locations and their connectors are available at run time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the PL/SQL, XPDL, SQL*Loader, or ABAP scripts from the Design Center to the Control Center.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To successfully deploy Oracle Warehouse Builder process flows to Oracle Workflow, ensure access to the correct version of Oracle Workflow as described in the <a class="olink WBINS" href="../e17130/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Warehouse Builder Installation and Administration Guide</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><a id="sthref1430"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">About Deploying Code Template (CT) Mappings and Web Services</h4>
<p>Before you deploy CT mappings or Web services, you must start the Control Center Agent as described in <a href="sap_km_mappings.htm#BABECFDC">"Starting the Control Center Agent (CCA)"</a>.</p>
<p>Deploying Code Template mappings or Web services includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate the <code>.ear</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the .ear files to the OC4J server associated with the Control Center Agent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="BIHEHEAI"></a>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h4 class="sect3">About Deploying Schedules</h4>
<p>Depending on the ETL objects that are associated with the schedule, you can deploy schedules to Oracle Database or Concurrent Manager.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso">
<p class="notep1">See Also:</p>
<a href="scheduling_etl.htm#CIHBBCID">"Overview of Deploying Schedules"</a> for more information about deploying schedules.</div>
<p>For remote Oracle Workflow locations and remote Oracle Warehouse Builder 10<span class="italic">g</span> locations to which schedules are deployed, ensure that the target location has the <code>CREATE SYNONYM</code> system privilege. If the evaluation location is specified or the deployment location references a different database instance from the Control Center schema, then the deployment location must have the <code>CREATE DATABASE LINK</code> system privilege.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref1431"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">About <a id="sthref1432"></a>Execution</h3>
<p>For objects that contain ETL logic (such as mappings, process flows, transformations, Code Template mappings, and Web services) there is an additional step of execution. Execution is the process of executing the ETL logic defined in the deployed objects.</p>
<p>Typically, objects are deployed and are run multiple times. When there are changes in the object definition, you must redeploy the objects. For example, you deploy a mapping after it is defined. The mapping can be run or scheduled to be run at specific intervals (daily or weekly). If the mapping definition changes, then you must redeploy the mapping.</p>
<p>For example, you define a mapping that sources data from a table, performs transformations on the source data, and loads it into the target table. When you deploy this mapping, the PL/SQL code generated for this mapping is stored in the target schema. When you run this mapping, the ETL logic is run and the data is picked up from the source table, transformed, and loaded into the target table.</p>
<p>Another example is of defining a Web service that checks if the data in a table conforms with the data rules defined for the table. When you deploy a Web service, the <code>.ear</code> file generated for the Web service is transferred to the Control Center Agent. When you run the Web service, the ETL logic defined in the Web service is run and a check is performed to verify that the data in the table does not violate any data rules defined on the table.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref1433"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">About Configurations</h3>
<p>Oracle Warehouse Builder separates the logical design of the objects from the physical details of the deployment. It creates this separation by storing the physical details in configuration parameters. An object called a <span class="italic">named configuration</span> stores all of the configuration settings. Use named configurations to implement different physical parameters for the same design on different systems (for example, development, production, testing). It enables you to easily move Oracle Warehouse Builder applications from the development to the test environment and then into production. For example, on the development system, you can specify the parallel settings as NOPARALLEL. On the production system, you can specify the parallel setting as PARALLEL with a degree of 16.</p>
<p>You can create a different named configuration for each deployment location, with different settings for the object parameters in each one. Each named configuration is associated with only one control center.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso">
<p class="notep1">See Also:</p>
<a class="olink WBINS" href="../e17130/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Warehouse Builder Installation and Administration Guide</span></a> for more information about creating multiple configurations.</div>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref1434"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">About Viewing and Setting Configuration Properties for Different Configurations</h3>
<p>When you create multiple configurations in a project, you can set different configuration parameters for an object in each configuration. At any time, only one of this configurations is activated, and is called the active configuration. For example, you have three configurations, <code>PROD_CONFIG</code>, <code>DEV_CONFIG</code>, and <code>QA_CONFIG</code>. For a table, <code>SALES_TAB</code>, you can set different configuration parameters in each of the three configurations.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso">
<p class="notep1">See Also:</p>
<a class="olink WBINS" href="../e17130/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Warehouse Builder Installation and Administration Guide</span></a> for more information about multiple configurations.</div>
<p>When you right-click and object and select <span class="bold">Configure</span>, the configuration parameters for the object in the active configuration, are displayed in a new Configure tab. If you change the active configuration by selecting a different configuration using the Configuration list on the toolbar, then the configuration parameters for the newly-activated configuration are listed to the right of the existing configuration parameters.</p>
<p>You can display the configuration parameters for other configurations defined in your project by clicking <span class="bold">Manage Configuration Columns</span> on the toolbar displayed at the top of the Configure tab. The Select Configurations dialog box is displayed. This dialog box lists all the configurations defined in the project. Select the configurations for which you want to display configuration parameters in the Configure tab and click <span class="bold">OK</span>. The parameters for the selected configurations are displayed, adjacent to the current configuration parameters.</p>
<p>You can compare the configuration property settings for different configurations by clicking <span class="bold">Highlight Differences</span> on the toolbar displayed at the top of the Configure tab. Oracle Warehouse Builder highlights the configuration parameters that have different settings in the various selected configurations. It enables you to compare the configuration settings an object in each configuration.</p>
<p>To delete the configuration parameters for a particular configuration from the Configure tab, click <span class="bold">Manage Configuration Columns</span>. In the Select Configurations dialog box that is displayed, deselect the configuration whose settings you want to remove from the Configure tab, and click <span class="bold">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The set of configuration parameters for the active configuration are always displayed in the Configure tab and you cannot delete this set.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Steps in the Deployment and <a id="sthref1435"></a>Execution Process</h2>
<p>During the lifecycle of a data system, you typically take these steps in the deployment process to create your system and the execution process to move data into your system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select a named configuration, from the list of configurations on the toolbar, with the object settings and the Control Center to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy data objects and ETL objects to the target location. You can deploy them individually, in stages, or all at once.</p>
<p>For information about deploying objects, see <a href="#i1088602">"Deploying Objects"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the results of the deployment. If an object fails to deploy, then fix the problem and try again.</p>
<p>For more information about deployment results, see <a href="#BIHIBEGD">"Reviewing Deployment Results"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For executable objects such as mappings or process flows, you can either start the ETL process immediately or schedule its execution for a later date.</p>
<p>For information about starting the ETL process, see <a href="#BEIDEDIG">"Starting ETL Jobs"</a>.</p>
<p>For information about scheduling ETL objects, see <a href="scheduling_etl.htm#CHDGEGJF">"Scheduling ETL Jobs"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revise the design of target objects to accommodate user requests, changes to the source data, and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the deployment action on the modified objects to Upgrade or Replace.</p>
<p>For more information about deployment actions, see <a href="#BABHDBGE">"About Deployment Actions"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps 1 to 4.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Deploying <a id="sthref1436"></a>Objects</h2>
<p>You can deploy objects using the Projects Navigator or Control Center Manager. Deployment from the Projects Navigator is restricted to the default action, which may be set to Create, Replace, Drop, or Update. The default action is determined by changes to the object design since it was last deployed. To override the default action, use the Control Center Manager, which provides full control over the deployment process.</p>
<p>After deploying an ETL object, you must explicitly start the scripts that perform the ETL operations defined in the ETL object, as described in <a href="#BEIDEDIG">"Starting ETL Jobs"</a>.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Starting ETL Jobs</h2>
<p>ETL is the process of extracting data from its source location, transforming it as defined in a mapping, and loading it into target objects. When you start execution of a mapping, process flow, or data auditor, you submit it as a job to Oracle Warehouse Builder job queue. The job can start immediately or at a scheduled time, if you create and use schedules. For more information about schedules, see <a href="scheduling_etl.htm#BIHDCJCD">"Defining Schedules"</a>.</p>
<p>Like deployment, you can run a mapping, process flow, or data auditor from the Projects Navigator or the Control Center Manager. You can also start these jobs by using tools outside of Oracle Warehouse Builder that runs SQL scripts.</p>
<p>Starting a mapping, process flow, or data auditor involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploying the objects, as needed.</p>
<p>For more information about deploying objects, see <a href="#i1088602">"Deploying Objects"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executing the object by using the Projects Navigator or Control Center Manager as described in the following sections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bold">To start ETL from the Projects Navigator:</span></p>
<p>Select the mapping or process flow, then select <span class="bold">Start</span> from the File menu.</p>
<p>For every ETL object that you run (start), a new tab containing an execution log is displayed in the Log window. The tab title is the object name followed by the job ID. Use this tab to monitor the status of the execution and to view execution results.</p>
<p>When you run objects that use the Control Center Agent, such as Code Template mappings or Web services, the job log files are located in the <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">OWB_HOME</span></code><code>/owb/jrt/log/jrt/job</code><code><span class="codeinlineitalic">job_id</span></code><code>/log.xml</code> directory path. In this directory path, <code><span class="codeinlineitalic">job_id</span></code> is the ID of the job that is run. Use this log file to troubleshoot any errors that may occur during the deployment and execution of Code Template mappings or Web services.</p>
<p><span class="bold">To start ETL from the Control Center Manager:</span></p>
<p>Select the mapping or process flow, then click <span class="bold">Start</span> on the toolbar.</p>

<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1455"></a>Scenario</p>
<p>You are in charge of managing a data warehouse that has been in production for a few months. The data warehouse was created by using two source schemas, Human Resources (<code>HR</code>) and Order Entry (<code>OE</code>) and was loaded into the Warehouse (<code>WH</code>) target schema. Recently you learned of two changes to tables in the <code>HR</code> and <code>OE</code> schemas. The <code>WH</code> schema must be updated to reflect these changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change #1: The first change was made to the <code>HR</code> schema. The length of the <code>REGION_NAME</code> column in the <code>REGIONS</code> table was changed from 25 to 100 characters.</p>
<p><a href="#BIHIEJJB">Figure 12-1</a> displays a representation of the changes to the <code>REGIONS</code> table.</p>

<p>Change #2: The second change was made to the <code>OE</code> schema. A row called <code>LOT_SIZE_NUMBER</code> was added to the <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> table with a data type of NUMBER, precision of 8, and scale of 0.</p>
<p><a href="#BIHIAFJH">Figure 12-2</a> displays a representation of the changed ORDER_ITEMS table.</p>

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" --></li>
</ul>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1458"></a>Solution</p>
<p>To update the <code>WH</code> schema, you must first determine the impact of these changes, and then create and run a plan for updating the target schema. The following steps provide an outline for what you must do:</p>
<p>"Step 1: Identify Changed Source Objects"</p>
<p>"Step 2: Determine the Impact of the Changes"</p>
<p>"Step 3: Reimport Changed Objects"</p>
<p>"Step 4: Update Objects in the Data Flow"</p>
<p>"Step 5: Redesign your Target Schema"</p>
<p>"Step 6: Redeploy Scripts"</p>
<p>"Step 7: Test the New ETL Logic"</p>
<p>"Step 8: Update Your Discoverer EUL"</p>
<p>"Step 9: Run the ETL Logic"</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1459"></a>Case Study</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1460"></a>Step 1: Identify Changed Source Objects</p>
<p>The first step in rolling out changes to your data warehouse is to identify the changes in source objects. You must have a procedure or system in place that can notify you when changes are made to source objects.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the group managing the <code>HR</code> and <code>OE</code> schemas informed you that some objects had been changed. The first change was made to the <code>HR</code> schema. The <code>REGION_NAME</code> column was extended from 25 to 100 characters to accommodate longer names. The second change was made to the <code>OE</code> schema. The <code>LOT_SIZE_NUMBER</code> column was added and must be integrated into the <code>WH</code> schema.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1461"></a>Step 2: Determine the Impact of the Changes</p>
<p>After you have identified the changes, you must determine their impact on your target schema.</p>
<p>For Change #1, made to the <code>HR</code> schema, you must update any dependent objects. This entails reimporting the <code>REGIONS</code> table and then updating any objects that use the <code>REGION_NAME</code> column. To identify dependent objects, you can use the Impact Analysis diagram. You also must update any mappings that use this table.</p>
<p>For Change #2, made to the <code>OE</code> schema, in addition to reimporting the table and updating mappings, you must find a way to integrate the new column into the <code>WH</code> schema. Because the column was added to keep track of the number of parts or items in one unit of sales, add a measure called <code>NUMBER_OF_IND_UNITS</code> to the <code>SALES</code> cube in the <code>WH</code> schema and have this measure for each order. Then you must connect this new column to the <code>SALES</code> cube.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1462"></a>Step 3: Reimport Changed Objects</p>
<p>Because two source objects have changed, you must reimport their metadata definitions into your workspace. Select both the <code>REGIONS</code> table in the <code>HR</code> schema and the <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> table in the <code>OE</code> schema from the navigation tree and use the Metadata Import Wizard to reimport their definitions.</p>
<p>Oracle Warehouse Builder automatically detects that this is an update and proceeds by only updating changed definitions. The Import Results dialog box that appears after the import process shows the details of the synchronization. Click <span class="bold">OK</span> to continue the import and commit your changes to the workspace. If you do not want to continue with the import, then click Undo.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1463"></a>Step 4: Update Objects in the Data Flow</p>
<p>If the change in the source object altered only existing objects and attributes, such as Change #1 in the <code>HR</code> schema, use Impact Analysis diagrams to identify objects that must be reconciled.</p>
<p>In this scenario, you must reconcile the column length in all objects that depend on the <code>REGIONS</code> table to ensure that the data continues to load properly.</p>
<p><span class="bold">To update objects in the data flow:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <code>REGIONS</code> table in the <code>HR</code> schema from the navigation tree. Select <span class="bold">View</span> and then click <span class="bold">Impact</span>.</p>
<p>A new tab is displayed in the Document Editor containing the Impact Analysis diagram. This reveals that the <code>CUSTOMER</code> dimension in the <code>WH</code> schema is the only object affected by the <code>REGIONS</code> table.</p>
<p>This step requires that you have set up the Repository Browser. For more information about setting this up, see <a class="olink WBINS" href="../e17130/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Warehouse Builder Installation and Administration Guide</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <code>CUSTOMER</code> dimension in the Dimension Editor and update the Region Name level attribute to the 100-character length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <code>MAP_CUSTOMER</code> mapping that connects the source to the target. For both the <code>REGIONS</code> Table operator and the <code>CUSTOMER</code> Dimension operator, perform an inbound synchronization from data object to mapping operator.</p>
<p>The mapping operators must be synchronized with the mapping objects that they represent to generate code based on the updated objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now completed updating the metadata associated with Change #1.</p>
<p>Because Change #2 introduced a new column, you need not update the data flow as you did for Change #1. Ensure that you perform an inbound synchronization on all the mappings that use an <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> Table operator. From the Impact Analysis diagram for the <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> table, you can see that only the mapping <code>MAP_SALES</code> is affected.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1464"></a>Step 5: Redesign your Target Schema</p>
<p>Because Change #2 introduced the new <code>LOT_SIZE_NUMBER</code> column to the <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> table, you must redesign your <code>WH</code> target schema to incorporate this new data into your cube. You can do this by adding a new measure called <code>NUMBER_OF_IND_UNITS</code> to your <code>SALES</code> cube.</p>
<p><span class="bold">To redesign the target schema:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the measure <code>NUMBER_OF_IND_UNITS</code> with the <code>NUMBER</code> data type, precision of 8, and scale of 0 to the <code>SALES</code> cube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the lineage diagram for the <code>SALES</code> cube to determine which mappings contain the <code>SALES</code> cube. Perform an inbound synchronization on all <code>SALES</code> cube mapping operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the mapping <code>MAP_SALES</code> and ensure that the table <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> is synchronized inbound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect the <code>LOT_SIZE_NUMBER</code> column in the <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code> table to the Joiner, and then to the Set Operation, and then add it to the Aggregator operator. Ensure that you are doing a Sum operation in the Aggregator operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, connect the <code>LOT_SIZE_NUMBER</code> output attribute of the Aggregator operator to the <code>NUMBER_OF_IND_UNITS</code> input attribute of the <code>SALES</code> cube.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1465"></a>Step 6: Redeploy Scripts</p>
<p>After the mappings have been debugged, use the Design Center to regenerate and redeploy scripts. Use the Control Center Manager to discover the default deployment action. Oracle Warehouse Builder detects the type of deployment to run.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1466"></a>Step 7: Test the New ETL Logic</p>
<p>After you have reconciled all objects and ensured that the <code>WH</code> target schema has been updated to reflect all changes, test the ETL logic that is be generated from the mappings. Use the Mapping Debugger to complete this task. If you find any errors, then resolve them and redeploy the scripts.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="sthref1467"></a>Step 8: Update Your Discoverer EUL</p>
<p>If you are using Oracle Discoverer as your reporting tool, proceed by updating your EUL.</p>
<p><span class="bold">To update your Oracle Discoverer EUL:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the objects that must be updated in the End User Layer (EUL) because of changes made to their structure or data. In this case, the changed objects are the <code>REGIONS</code> and <code>SALES_ITEMS</code> tables and the <code>SALES</code> cube.</p>
