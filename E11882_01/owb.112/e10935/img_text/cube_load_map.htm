<body>
<p>This screenshot displays a mapping that loads a cube. On the left are the Table operators ORDERS_IN, ORDER_ITEMS_IN, and ADDRESSES_IN. To the right of these operators is the Joiner operator Next JOINER. To the right of JOINER are the Expression operator TO_CHAR_EXPR and the Lookup operator CHANNELS_LKP. To the right of these operators is the Aggregator operator AGGREGATOR. At the extreme right is the Cube operator ALL_SALES_OUT.</p>
<p>The ORDERS_IN, ORDER_ITEMS_IN, and ADDRESSES_IN are mapped to JOINER. JOINER is mapped to AGGREGATOR, both directly and through TO_CHAR_EXPR and CHANNELS_LKP. AGGREGATOR is mapped to ALL_SALES_OUT.</p>
