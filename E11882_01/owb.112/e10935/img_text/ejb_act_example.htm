<p>This graphic displays a process flow that uses an Enterprise Java Bean activity to leverage functionality existing in the form of an EJB suite.</p>
<p>It contains the following activities, from left to right: START1, ORDERS_REPORT, LOAD_ORDERS, EMAIL_ERROR and EMAIL_WARNING (one below the other), and END_ERROR, END_SUCCESS, and END_WARNING (one below another). Arrows are used to connect START1 to ORDERS_REPORT and ORDERS_REPORT to LOAD_ORDERS. There are three arrows from LOAD_ORDERS, one to EMAIL_ERROR, one to EMAIL_WARN, and one to END_SUCCESS. EMAIL_ERR is connected to END_ERROR and EMAIL_WARN to END_WARNING.</p>
