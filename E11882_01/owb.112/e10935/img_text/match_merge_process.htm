<p>This image depicts the matching and merging process. On the left are three icons that represent the data sources. To the right of the data sources is a set of overlapping rectangles, which are connected to the sources by an arrow. To the right of this are two rectangles, one below the other, representing the valid matched sets. An arrow, with Match Rules written on it, connects to the valid matched sets. To the right of the valid matched sets are two rectangles, one below the other, that represent the merged objects. Arrows connect the rectangle at the top of the valid matched sets to the rectangle at the top of the merged objects and the rectangle at the bottom of the valid matched sets the one at the bottom of the merged objects.</p>
