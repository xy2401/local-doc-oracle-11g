<p>This screenshot shows a sample process flow. It has a Start activity, which is linked to a mapping MAP1. The mapping is connected to two conditions ordered from top to bottom, EMAIL_SUCCESS and EMAIL_FAIL.</p>
<p>If MAP1 is successful, an email is sent using the EMAIL_SUCCESS activity and then the subprocess, SUBPROC, that is linked to it is run. After executing the subprocess, the process flow ends with END_SUCCESS activity. There is an arrow from MAP1 to EMAIL_SUCCESS, from EMAIL_SUCCESS to SUBPROC and from SUBPROC to END_SUCCESS.</p>
<p>If the Mapping is not successful, then it sends a failure email, represented by EMIAL_FAIL, and the process ends with an error. This is represented by an arrow from MAP1 to EMAIL_FAIL and from EMAIL_FAIL to END_ERROR.</p>
