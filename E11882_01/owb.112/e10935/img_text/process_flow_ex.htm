<p>This image displays a process flow. On the left is a Start activity START1, followed by a Fork activity FORK. To the right of FORK, one below the other, are the Mapping activities LOAD_PRODUCTS, LOAD_CUSTOMERS, and LOAD_CATEGORIES. To the right of these activities is the And activity AND1, followed by the Mapping activity LOAD_SALES_CUBE, which is then followed by END_SUCCESS.</p>
<p>A arrow connects START1 to FORK. There are three arrows from FORK, one each to LOAD_PRODUCTS, LOAD_CUSTOMERS, and LOAD_CATEGORIES. These three Mapping activities are connected to AND1, which is connected to LOAD_SALES_CUBE using arrows. An arrow also connects LOAD_SALES_CUBE to END_SUCCESS.</p>
