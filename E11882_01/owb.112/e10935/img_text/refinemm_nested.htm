<p>This image displays a mapping that uses two Match Merge operators. The mapping contains the following operators, from left to right: CUSTOMERS, MM, ADDRESS, MM_1, and NAME. CUSTOMERS provides input to MM, which in turn produces an ADDRESS table as output. The XREF group of the first Match Merge operator, MM, is mapped to a second Match Merge operator, MM_1. The operator MM_1 is mapped to NAME.</p>
