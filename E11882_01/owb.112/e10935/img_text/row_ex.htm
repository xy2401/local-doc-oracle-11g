<p>This graphic shows a simple mapping run in a row-based mode. To the left is a table TAB1. In the center is FLTR, representing a Filter operator. To the right is a table TAB2. The output of TAB1 is SQL and is provided as input to the Filter. This is represented by an arrow connecting TAB1 to FLTR and another arrow connecting FLTR to TAB2.</p>
<p>During data transfer, the input from TAB1 is converted from SQL to PL/SQL. The output of the filter is PL/SQL and is provided as an input to a table TAB2.</p>
