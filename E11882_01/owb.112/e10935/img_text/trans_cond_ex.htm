<p>This screenshot shows a mapping called MAP1 on the left side. In the center, ordered from top to bottom, are a subprocess activity SUBPROC1 and two Email activities E_MAP1_WARN and E_MAP1_ERR. On the right are the following activities, ordered from top to bottom: END_SUCCESS, END1, and END_ERROR.</p>
<p>There are arrows from MAP1 to SUBPROC1, E_MAP_WARN, and E_MAP_ERR. This represents the flow of data from MAP1 to these activities, depending on the result of the mapping execution. If there are any warnings, the data flows from the mapping to the activity E_MAP1_WARN and then to END1. If there are errors in the mapping, the data flows from the mapping to the E_MAP1_ERR and then to the END_ERROR.</p>
