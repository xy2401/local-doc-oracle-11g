<ol>
<li>
<p>One Oracle Database is installed on the Server 1 computer. The Oracle Database contains a Repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Repository contains at least one Workspace, which contains Audit Tables, TS1 (with Map, T1, and T2), SS1 (with T1, and T2), and SS2 (with T1, and T2).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other Oracle Database is installed on the Server 2 computer. The Oracle Database contains a Repository, a Target Schema, Source Schema 1 and Source Schema 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Repository contains at least one Workspace, which contains Audit Tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Target Schema contains a Map, T1, and T2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Source Schema 1 contains S1, and S2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Source Schema 2 contains S1, and S2.</p>

<p>The Design Center is installed on the client computer, and it manages the <span class="bold">design</span> inside the Repository that is in the Oracle Database (on the Server 1 computer). It also <span class="bold">deploys</span> and <span class="bold">executes</span> on Oracle Warehouse Builder Control Center Service (on the Server 2 computer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Local OC4J service is installed on the client computer, and it contains the Browser Server. It <span class="bold">reports</span> on the Repository in the Oracle Database (on the Server 1 computer), and it <span class="bold">reports</span> on the Audit Tables that are in the Workspace of the Repository in the Oracle Database that is on Server 2 computer. It also <span class="bold">receives</span> and <span class="bold">updates</span> Oracle Warehouse Builder Browser's Design Reports and Audit Reports (on the client computer).</p>
