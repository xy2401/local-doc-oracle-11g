<p>This graphic represents a Topology where the Client, the Control Center Service, and the Oracle Database are each installed on a different computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Oracle Database is installed on the server computer, and it contains a Repository, a Target Schema, Source Schema 1 and Source Schema 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Repository contains at least one Workspace, which contains Audit Tables, TS1 (with Map, T1, and T2), SS1 (with T1, and T2), and SS2 (with T1, and T2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Target Schema contains a Map, T1, and T2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Source Schema 1 contains S1, and S2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Source Schema 2 contains S1, and S2.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Warehouse Builder Control Center Service is installed on its own computer; it <span class="bold">deploys</span> and <span class="bold">executes</span> on the Map of the Target Schema in the Oracle Database on the server computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Design Center is installed on the client computer. It manages the <span class="bold">design</span> inside the Repository that is in the Oracle Database on the server computer. It also <span class="bold">deploys</span> and <span class="bold">executes</span> on Oracle Warehouse Builder Control Center Service, which is installed on its own computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Local OC4J service is installed on the client computer. It contains the Browser Server. It <span class="bold">reports</span> on the Repository in the Oracle Database that is on the server computer, and it <span class="bold">reports</span> on the Audit Tables that are in the Workspace of that Repository (on the server computer).
