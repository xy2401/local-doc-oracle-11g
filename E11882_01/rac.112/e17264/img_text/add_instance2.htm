<p>The screenshot shows the Add Instance: Host page. At the top of the page, on the left-hand side it says "Name of the database instance to be added". This is followed by a text entry box that contains the value RACDB3. On the right-hand side of the page, near the top, are 3 buttons: Cancel, Back, and Next. Between the Back and Next buttons is the text "Step 2 of 3".</p>
<p>Below the name of the instance to be added is the following explanatory text: "The following list of hosts have database software installed and are currently configured for this cluster. Select a host to which you want to add a database instance. This host should have access to the shared storage used by this database."</p>
<p>The text is followed by a table. The table has 3 columns: Select, Host, and Existing Database Instances. There are 3 rows in the table. The rows contain the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not selected, node01, RACDB1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not selected, node02, RACDB2</p>

</ul>
<p>Below the table is the following text: "TIP You can clone an Oracle Home to a host where database software is not installed. Clone Oracle Home (hyperlinked)"</p>
