<p>The screenshot shows the Cluster Cache Coherency page. Below the page title are 2 options: Graphical Chart (selected), Tabular Format. Each option is followed by an information icon that can be clicked to obtain more information about that option. On the upper right-hand side of the page is the View Data action list with the value Real Time: 15 Second Refresh selected.</p>
<p>The page contains the following graphs, from top to bottom: the Global Cache Block Access Latency chart, the Global Cache Block Transfer Rate chart, and the Global Cache Block Transfers and Physical Reads (vs. Logical Reads) chart. Each chart has a title on the top left side of the chart, axis labels, and a legend box to the right of the chart. On each chart, the horizontal axis shows the time in 10 minute increments. Each chart has different lines on it to represent different performance statistics measured.</p>
<p>The Global Cache Block Access Latency chart has the label Milli-Seconds for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists the metrics: Average CR Block Receive Time and Average Current Block Access Receive Time. The chart has a horizontal red line representing the value of 2 milliseconds. For the chart displayed in this screenshot, the two lines representing the metrics are below this threshold line, except for a couple of times when an activity spike occurred.</p>
<p>The Global Cache Block Transfer Rate chart has the label Block Per Second for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists two metrics: GC Current Blocks Received and GC CR Blocks Received. The line that represents each metric is close to 0, except for a large spike around 10:20 am when the number of GC Current Blocks Received jumped to 13.</p>
<p>The Global Cache Block Transfers and Physical Reads (vs. Logical Reads) chart has the label % for the vertical axis. The legend for this chart lists the metrics: Physical Reads and Global Cache Block Transfers. The lines in the chart for each metric vary in value from 0 to 4.</p>
