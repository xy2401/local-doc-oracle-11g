</head>
<body>
<p>The screenshot shows the Performance subpage for the cluster. At the top, right-hand side of the page is a View Data action list, with the value Real Time: 15 Second Refresh currently selected. Below this list is a Customize button.</p>
<p>On the left-hand side of the page, at the top, are two options: Summary Chart (selected) and Tile Chart (not selected).</p>
<p>There are 3 charts displayed in the screenshot: CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, and Disk I/O Utilization.</p>
<p>The CPU Utilization chart measures the number of CPUs on the vertical axis and the time in increments of 2 minutes on the horizontal axis. There are two lines on the chart, each line representing a different host. The pmrac1.us.oracle.com host appears to be using slightly more CPU resources than the host pmrac2.us.oracle.com.</p>
<p>The Memory Utilization chart measures the percentage of memory utilized on the vertical axis and the time in 2 minute increments on the horizontal axis. There are two lines on the chart, each line representing a different host. Both of the lines are straight, with the host pmrac2.us.oracle.com showing a constant memory utilization of 80.00 and the host pmrac1.us.orale.com showing a constant memory utilization of 100.00 for the time period between 8:32 pm and 8:46pm on July 10, 2007.</p>
<p>The Disk I/O Utilization chart measures the disk I/O utilization on the vertical axis using values from 0.00 to 200.00, in increments of 50. The horizontal axis measures the time in increments of 2 minutes. There are two lines on the chart, each line representing a different host. The host pmrac1.us.oracle.com appears to be utilizing slightly more disk I/O than the host pmrac2.us.oracle.com.</p>
