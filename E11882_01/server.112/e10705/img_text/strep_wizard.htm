<p>This screenshot shows the first page of the Setup Streams Replication Wizard in Enterprise Manager. At the top is an arrow showing the pages of the wizard, including Source Options, Destination Options, Replication Options, Schedule, and Review. Under the arrow, the page title reads, "Setup Streams Replication: Object Selection". Below the title is the text, "All the tables listed in the table below will be captured. Table Replication will be configured for each table without a Subset condition and Subset Replication will be configured for each table with a subset condition." Next there is a Cancel button, the text "Step 1 of 5," and a Next button.</p>
<p>Below the buttons is the Include Tables section. This section includes the text, "To specify that replication should be configured for a table, add them to the table below." Next is a table with an Add button at the top. The table has the following blank fields: Selected, Schema, Table, and Subset Condition.</p>
<p>Below the table is the following text: "TIP A subset condition is a special type of table rule for DML changes that is relevant only to a subset of the rows in a table. You can specify a condition that will allow the replication of table rows pertaining to that condition only. e.g. to replicate hr.regions table where the region_id is 2 enter 'region_id=2' against the hr.regions table."</p>
<p>Next there is a Cancel button, the text "Step 1 of 5," and a Next button.</p>
