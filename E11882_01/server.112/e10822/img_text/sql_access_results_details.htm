Below this text, on the right-hand side of the page is a link for the previous page (disabled), and action list for selecting which options are displayed (the value "1-10 of 29" is selected), and a link for Next 10. The table has 3 columns, which are named, from left to right: Option, Value, and Description. There are 10 rows displayed in the table.

<p>The Journal Entries table has descriptive text below the title which reads "These are the messages that were logged to the advisor journal while the task was executing.

Below this text, on the right-hand side of the page is a link for the previous page (disabled), and action list for selecting which options are displayed (the value "1-10 of 18" is selected), and a link for the Next 8.
