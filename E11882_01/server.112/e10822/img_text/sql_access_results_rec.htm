<p>The Recommendations by Cost Improvement section contains a bar chart. The vertical axis measures the Cost Improvement, with values from 1.5 to 4.5 incrementing by 0.5. The horizontal axis shows the ID, with values, from left to right, of 1, 3, 4, and 2. The legend shows that the blue bars measure Cost Improvement. All the bars in the graph are blue.</p>
<ul>

The buttons are labeled, from left to right, Recommendation Details, Schedule Implementation, and Show SQL. Below the Recommendation Details button are 2 links, Select All and Select None.</p>
