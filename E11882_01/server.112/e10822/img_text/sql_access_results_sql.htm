<p>The screenshot shows a portion of the SQL Statements subpage. There are two sections displayed: SQL Statements By Cost Improvement and Select SQL Statements to be Improved.</p>
<p>The SQL Statements By Cost Improvement section contains a bar chart. The vertical axis measures Cost Improvement with values from 1.5 to 4.5 incrementing by 0.5. The horizontal axis contains the Statement ID, with values, from left to right: 2421, 1905, 2192, and 2283. According to the legend, blue bars indicate Cost Improvement. There are 4 blue bars in the graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For statement ID 2421, the cost improvement is about 4.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For statement ID 1905, the cost improvement is about 2.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For statement ID 2192, the cost improvement is about 2.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For statement ID 2283, the cost improvement is about 2.0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Select SQL Statements to be Improved section contains a table. Just below the section heading is the option "Affected SQL Statements", which is selected. Below this option are two buttons: Schedule Implementation and Show SQL. Below the buttons and just above the table are 2 links: Select All and Select None. The table has 9 columns and 4 rows. The columns headings, from left to right, are: Select (an option box), Statement ID, Statement, Recommendation ID, Original Cost, New Cost, Cost Improvement, Cost Improvement (%), and Execution Count. The rows in the table have the following values, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not selected, 2421 (hyperlinked), "select e.employee_id, e.last_name, d.department_name from employees e, departments d where e.department_id = d.department_id", 1 (hyperlinked), 7, 3, 4, 57.14, 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not selected, 1905 (hyperlinked), "select sum(unit_cost) from costs group by prod_id", 4 (hyperlinked), 8, 6, 2, 25.00, 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not selected, 2192 (hyperlinked), "SELECT c.cust_last_name, sum(s.amount_sold) AS dollars, sum(s.quantity_sold) as quantity FROM sales s, customers c, products p WHERE c.cust_id = s.cust_id AND s.prod_id = p.prod_id AND c.cust_state_province IN ('Dublin','Galway') GROUP BY c.cust_last_name", 2 (hyperlinked), 8, 6, 2, 25.00, 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selected, 2283 (hyperlinked), "SELECT c.cust_id, SUM(amount_sold) AS dollar_sales FROM sales s, customers c HWERE s.cust_id = c.cust_id GROUP BY c.cust_id", 3 (hyperlinked), 8, 6, 2, 25.00, 2</p>
