<p>The screenshot shows the Summary subpage of the Results for Tasks page. The other subtabs shown, but not selected, are Recommendations, SQL Statements, and Details.</p>
<p>The Summary subpage has 5 sections. At the top is Overall Workload Performance. In the middle is Workload I/O Cost on the left and Query Execution Time Improvement on the right. At the bottom are Recommendations on the left and SQL Statements on the right.</p>
<p>The Overall Workload Performance section has an information icon (the letter i in a chat bubble) followed by the words "Potential for Improvement"</p>
<p>The Workload I/O Cost section has a bar chart that compares the workload I/O cost for the Original Cost (877), indicated by a red bar, with the New Cost (867), indicated by a smaller blue bar. The vertical axis measures the workload I/O cost, with values from 865.0 to 877.5 in increments of 2.5</p>
<p>The Query Execution Time Improvement section also has a bar chart. The vertical axis is the percentage of statements, and has values from 0 to 100 incrementing by 25. The horizontal axis measures the Query Improvement Factor with values of 1x, 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, and &gt;10x. The legend contains only 2 entries: No Performance Improvement, indicated by the gray bars and Potential Performance Improvement, indicated by the blue bars. The graph indicates that 75% of the queries would see no improvement, as indicated by the large gray bar, No Performance Improvement, at 1x. Approximately 20 percent of the statements have a potential query execution time improvement of 4x, and 5 percent of the statements have a potential query execution time improvement of 6x, as indicated by the blue bars at 4x and 6x. There are no other bars on the chart.</p>
