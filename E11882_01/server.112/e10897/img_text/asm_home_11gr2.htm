<body>
<p>This screenshot shows the Oracle ASM Home page in Enterprise Manager. On the left-hand side of the page is a general section, which includes information on instance name, instance status, version, Oracle home location, and more. On the right-hand side of the page is a pie chart graph, with each section representing how space is distributed in Oracle ASM (Free, Internal, or Used, where Used is represented by the instance name). A diagnostic summary section at the left displays the number of active incidents in the system. At the bottom of the page are four tables, named, from top to bottom: Serviced Databases, Serviced ASM Cluster File Systems, Other Volumes, and Alerts.</p>
<p>The first table lists the databases that use this Oracle ASM instance. In the screenshot it contains only one row, for the orcl instance. The second table lists the Oracle ASM Cluster File Systems associated with this Oracle ASM instance. In the screenshot this table contains the message "(No ASM Cluster File Systems)". The third table lists the other volumes associated with this Oracle ASM instance, but there are no rows in the table (No object found). The last table lists the Alerts for this Oracle ASM instance. It contains 1 severe alert which indicates the "Disk group DATA has used 92.87% of safely usable free space".</p>
