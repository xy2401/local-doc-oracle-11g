<title>Description of the illustration auto_maint_task_config.gif</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a screenshot of the Automated Maintenance Task Configuration page. Just below the title is the Global Status option, for which Enabled is currently selected, and Disabled is not.</p>
<p>The first section of the page is titled Task Settings, and is a series of options, arranged from top to bottom, that enable you to enable or disable each type of automated maintenance task: Optimizer Statistics Gathering, Segment Advisor, and Automatic SQL Tuning. There is also a Configure button for the Optimizer Statistics Gathering and Automatic SQL Tuning tasks.</p>
<p>The second section shown in the screenshot is the Maintenance Window Group Assignment section. It contains a table with four columns: Window (which contains the names of all current maintenance windows), Optimizer Statistics Gathering, Segment Advisor, and Automatic SQL Tuning. There are 10 rows, one for each existing maintenance window, which are named MID_MORNING_WINDOW, MID_AFTERNOON_WINDOW, MID_EVENING_WINDOW, WEDNESDAY_WINDOW, THURSDAY_WINDOW, FRIDAY_WINDOW, and so on. At the top of the other three columns are two hyperlinks: Select All and Select None. In each row of the table, the last 3 columns contain a check box, which is checked, indicating that task is enabled for that maintenance window.</p>
<p>Above the table to the right is an Edit Window Group button. Below the table to the right are three buttons: Show SQL, Revert, and Apply.</p>
