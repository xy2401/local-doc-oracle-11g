</head>
<body>
<p>The screenshot shows the Automatic SQL Tuning Result Summary page. There are four sections of this page shown in the screenshot. They are (listed in order from top to bottom) Task Status, Summary Time Period, Overall Task Statistics, and Profile Effect Statistics.</p>
<p>The Task Status section shows the status of the task Automatic SQL Tuning (SYS_AUTO_SQL_TUNING_TASK) as currently Enabled. Next to this status is a button labeled Configure. The next line in this section shows the status of the task Automatic Implementation of SQL Profiles as currently Disabled. Next to this status is a button labeled Configure. The last status line displayed in this section is the number of Key SQL Profiles, which is zero.</p>
<p>The Summary Time Period section has a Time Period list that allows you to set the time period for the data displayed in the Overall Task Statistics and Profile Effect Statistics sections. The Time Period field currently displays the value All. Next to the Time Period field are two buttons: Go and View Report. Below the Time Period field are two dates, corresponding to the Begin Date and End Date of the selected time period.</p>
<p>The Overall Task Statistics section starts with the following information: Execution 5, Candidate SQL 41, Distinct SQL Examined 9. There are two charts in this section. The SQL Examined Status pie chart displays the proportion of SQL Examined With Findings (8), SQL Examined Without Findings(1), and SQL Skipped Due To Errors (0). In the pie chart, SQL Examined Without Findings constitutes 89% and SQL Examined With Findings constitutes 11% of the total area.</p>
<p>The second chart in the Overall Task Statistics section is the Breakdown by Finding Type bar chart. This chart shows the Number of SQL statements (vertical axis) for each of the following categories (horizontal axis): SQL Profile, Index, Statistics, Restructure SQL, and Alternative Plan. The Legend for this chart indicates that green bars indicated implemented findings and blue bars represent findings that have not been implemented. All the bars in the chart shows in the screenshot are blue. The number of SQL statements for each category is: SQL Profile (2), Index (0), Statistics (8), Restructure SQL (1), and Alternative Plan (3).</p>
<p>The section Profile Effect Statistics contains a bar chart titled Workload Potential DB Time Benefit (seconds per week). Under the title there are two values shown: Implemented (sec), which shows 0, and Potential Benefit (sec), which shows 0. The vertical axis on the bar chart is labeled DB Time (s), with values ranging from 0 to 1.2. The horizontal axis has two categories: Implemented and Recommended. The Legend for the chart indicates that navy blue bars represent the DB Time estimate before implementing a recommendation, and light blue bars represent the DB Time estimate after implementing a recommendation. There is no data for the Implemented category. For the Recommended category, there are two values displayed: Before and After, as side-by-side bars. These bars show approximately 1 second for Before and approximately 1 second for After.</p>
