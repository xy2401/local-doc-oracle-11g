<p>This is a screenshot of the Create Tablespace page. At the top right-hand corner of the page are three buttons: Show SQL, Cancel, and OK. Below the buttons, at the left-hand side of the page, are two links that you can click to display the two property pages, General and Storage. The General property page is currently displayed. Below the links is a text field for the tablespace name. Below this are the following three sections, going across the page from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extent Management—With this section, you choose the Locally Managed option, or the Dictionary Managed option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type—In this section, you choose among the following three options: Permanent, Temporary, or Undo. The Permanent option has two accompanying check boxes named "Set as default permanent tablespace" and "Encryption". Following the Encryption check box is a button labeled Encryption Options. The Temporary option has an accompanying check box named "Set as default temporary tablespace." The Undo option has an accompanying set of options named "Undo Retention Guarantee." The options are Yes and No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Status—With this section, you choose the Read Write option, the Read Only option, or the offline option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below these sections is a Datafile section that occupies the entire bottom of the page. It includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A check box entitled "Use bigfile tablespace"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of the data files that are associated with the tablespace. The table columns are as follows: Select, Name, Directory, Size (MB). There are no rows in the table. Instead, the message "No items found" appears. Above the table, toward the right-hand side, is an Add button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
