<p>This image is a partial screenshot of the Database Home page, which is showing the Home subpage. The page heading is "Database Instance," followed by the instance name, which in this case is "orcl.example.com". Beneath the heading, a row of links goes horizontally across the page. Each is the title of a separate Enterprise Manager subpage, where each subpage contains different administrative functions. The subpage titles are Home (highlighted because it is the current page), Performance, Availability, Server, Schema, Data Movement, and Software and Support. Beneath the subpage links are the various sections of the home page, including General (for instance and listener information), Host CPU, Active Sessions, SQL Response Time, Diagnostic Summary, Space Summary, High Availability, Alerts, Related Alerts, and Policy Violations. Each section has various combinations of links, controls, and text or graphical elements that display database status. .</p>
