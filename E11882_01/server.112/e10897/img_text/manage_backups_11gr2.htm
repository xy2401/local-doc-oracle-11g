At the top of the page are four buttons, ordered from left to right: Catalog Additional Files, Crosscheck All, Delete All Obsolete, and Delete All Expired. Beneath the buttons, a row of links goes horizontally across the page. Each is the title of a subpage, where each subpage contains different administrative functions. The subpage titles are Backup Sets and Image Copies. The Backup Sets subpage is currently displayed.</p>
<p>Beneath the subpage links are the various sections of the Backup Sets subpage. The Search section contains the follow controls, ordered from top to bottom: A status drop-down list (currently showing "Available"), the label "Contents" followed by four check boxes aligned horizontally across the page, and a Completion Time drop-down list (currently showing "Within a month"). To the right of the Completion time list is a Go button. The four "Contents" check boxes are the following, from left to right: Datafile, Archived Redo Log, SPFILE, and Control File.</p>
<p>In the Results section, the following buttons are arranged horizontally from left to right: Crosscheck, Change to Unavailable, Delete, and Validate.
