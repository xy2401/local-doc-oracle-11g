The chart legend indicates the Percentage improvement in DB Time for various sizes of Total Mem is shown as a blue line, the Total Memory size is shown as a pair of green lines that intersect the blue curve at the point (400 MB, -4%), and the Maximum Memory Size is shown as a pair of red lines that intersect the blue curve at the point (520 MB, 0%). The intersecting green lines appear when you click on a point on the chart that is below the Maximum Memory Size.</p>
<p>Below the chart is the following text "You can click on the curve in the graph to set a new value. Total Memory Size cannot be greater than the Maximum Memory Size. First modify the Maximum Memory size (from the parent page) and then select a value of Total Memory up to the Maximum Memory size."</p>
