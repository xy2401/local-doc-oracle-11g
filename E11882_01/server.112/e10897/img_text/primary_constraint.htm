<title>Description of the illustration primary_constraint.gif</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a screenshot of the Add PRIMARY Constraint page. At the top right-hand corner of the page are two buttons, ordered from left to right: Cancel and Continue. Below the buttons is a primer on primary key constraints. Below this are the following sections, going down the page:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Definition—This section contains a text field for the constraint name. It is populated with a system-assigned name that you can accept as a default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table Columns—This section contains an Available Columns list at the left (showing four columns names), a Selected Columns list at the right (empty), and four buttons between them, arranged vertically: Move, Move All, Remove, and Remove All. The intention is that you move columns from the left list to the right list to include them in the primary key. To the right of the Selected Columns list are four small buttons, arranged vertically. The buttons are just icons with up or down arrows in them, but their functions are as follows, as indicated by the pop-up message that appears when you mouse over the buttons: Move selected items to top of list, Move selected items up one in list, Move selected items down one in list, and Move selected items to bottom of list. Their purpose is to order the columns that make up the primary key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attributes—This section contains a series of check boxes that control how the constraint is applied and enforced. For example, one of them is entitled Disabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
