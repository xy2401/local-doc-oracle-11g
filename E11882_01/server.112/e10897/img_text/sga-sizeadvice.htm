<p>This screenshot shows the SGA Size Advice page. It is a graph that plots Improvement in DB Time (%) on the vertical axis and Total SGA Size (MB) on the horizontal axis. The legend for the graph contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Percentage improvement in DB Time for various sizes of SGA (in blue text and preceded by a square bullet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total SGA Size (in green text, and preceded by an X)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum SGA Size (in red text and preceded by a square bullet)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The vertical axis is marked with numbers from -80 to 10, in intervals of 10. The horizontal axis is marked with numbers from 100 to 800 in intervals of 100. In the graph, there is a blue line that starts at approximately (180, -74) and arcs upwards to approximately (440, 6), after which it becomes a horizontal line. There are two straight lines that intersect this curve. The first line is horizontal, and intersects the curve at approximately (0, 350). The second line is vertical, and intersects the curve at approximately (0, 350). There is a X at this point.</p>
<p>Below the graph is a line which states "Total SGA Size (MB) 352". Below this line is the following paragraph: "You can click on the curve in the graph to set a new value. Total SGA Size cannot be greater than the SGA Max Size. First modify the Max SGA Size (from the parent page) and then select a value of SGA up to the Max SGA size."</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screenshot, on the right-hand side are two buttons: Cancel and OK.</p>
