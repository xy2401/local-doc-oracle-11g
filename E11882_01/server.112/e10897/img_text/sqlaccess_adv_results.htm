<title>Description of the illustration sqlaccess_adv_results.gif</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The screenshot shows a portion of the Results for Task page for a SQL Access Advisor task. There are two main sections in the screenshot: Overall Workload Performance and Recommendations.</p>
<p>In the Overall Workload Performance, there is the text Potential for Improvement, which is preceded by an information icon. Below this are two subsections: Workload I/O Cost and Query Execution Time Improvement.</p>
<p>In the Workload I/O Cost section, there is a bar graph of the original workload cost and the projected new workload cost. In this screenshot, the original workload cost is 38 and the new workload cost is 22.</p>
<p>In the Query Execution Time Improvement section there is a bar graph illustrating how many q ueries can have improved performance, and by what factor. In this screenshot, 40% of the analyzed SQL statements would show little to no improvement and 60% of the analyzed SQL statements could potentially be improved by a factor of 6x.</p>
<p>In the Recommendations section, on the left-hand side, the screenshot shows that there are 3 recommendations (hyperlinked), which would require 0.039 MB to implement. There is a hyperlink titled Show Recommendation Action Counts, which is not expanded in this screenshot.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the Recommendations section, the screenshot shows that there are 5 (hyperlinked) SQL statements analyzed, based on the filters used in the SQL Access Advisor tuning task. Below this is the hyperlink Show Statement Counts, which is not expanded in this screenshot.</p>
