<p>This is a screenshot of the Performance Finding Details: Top SQL Statements page. At the top of the page is the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finding: SQL statements consuming significant database time were found. These statements offer a good opportunity for performance improvement. (Finding History button).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact (Active Sessions): 4.6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Percentage of Finding's Impact (%): 47.6 (also displayed as a bar chart)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Period Start Time: June 24, 2009 9:35:50 AM PDT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Period Duration (minutes): 1.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtered: No (Filters button)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below this information is the Recommendations section. The first item in this section is a button labeled Schedule SQL Tuning Advisor. Next is a table of recommendations. At the top of the table are 4 hyperlinks: Select All, Select None, Show All Details, Hide All Details. The table has the following columns: Select, Details, Category, and Benefit (%). The data for the last column is displayed as a horizontal bar graph in each row, followed by the percentage value. In the Details column, each row has a Show icon, that if clicked, "opens" the row to reveal recommendation details, including action buttons such as Run Advisor Now and Filters. For the "opened" rows, the Details column contains a Hide icon.</p>
<p>This table shown in this screenshot has 4 rows, each a SQL Tuning recommendation. The last 3 rows in the table are not "opened". The first row, which is "opened", contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not selected, Hide icon, SQL Tuning, 20.6 (Benefit %)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action: Run SQL Tuning Advisor on the SELECT statement with SQL_ID "axabnfyfp4r3p". Additionally, investigate this statement for possible performance improvements. You can supplement the information given here with an ASH report for this SQL_ID. (Run Advisor NoW button) (Filters button)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQL Text SELECT E.LAST_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE, D.DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM HR.EMPLOYEES E, HR.DEPAR... (hyperlinked)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL ID axabnfyfp4r3p (hypterlinked)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action: Use bigger fetch arrays while fetching results from the SELECT statement with SQL_ID "axabnfyfp4r3p".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQL Text SELECT E.LAST_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE, D.DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM HR.EMPLOYEES E, HR.DEPAR... (hyperlinked)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL ID axabnfyfp4r3p (hypterlinked)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale, "The SQL spent 30% of its database time on CPU, I/O and Cluster waits. This part of database time may be improved by the SQL Tuning Advisor. Look at data given below and an ASH report for further performance improvements."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale, "Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 100% for SQL execution, 0% for parsing, 0% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java execution."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale, "SQL statement with SQL_ID 'axabnfyfp4r3p' was executed 35402 times and had an average elapsed time of 0.0062 seconds."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale, "Waiting for event 'resmgr:cou quantum' in wait class 'Scheduler' accounted for 53% of the database time spent in processing the SQL statement with SQL_ID 'axabnfyfp4r3p'."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rationale, "Top level calls to execute the PL/SQL statement with SQL_ID '357p6hzg9gat' are responsible for 100% of the database time spent on the SELECT statement with SQL_ID 'axabnfyfp4r3p'."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQL Text DECLARE n number; v_employees_last_name ... (hyperlinked)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQL ID 357p6hzg9gat (hypterlinked)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
