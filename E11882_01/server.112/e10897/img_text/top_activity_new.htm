<p>This is a screenshot of the Top Activity page. An active sessions graph takes up the entire top half of the page. This graph measures activity for the following categories: Other, Queueing, Network, Administrative, Configuration, Commit, Application, Concurrency, System I/O, User I/O, Scheduler, and CPU + CPU Wait.</p>
<p>Below this chart is the Detail for Selected 5 Minute Interval section. On the left hand side of this section is a Top SQL table, which, for each statement, shows Activity percent as a horizontal bar graph. The columns in this table are Select, Activity (%), SQL ID, and SQL Type. The table is currently showing the top 10 statements, 6 of which have the SQL Type of SELECT, 1 statement has the SQL Type of CALL METHOD, 1 statement has the SQL Type of INSERT, and 2 statements have 189 for the SQL Type. All of the statements show have an activity percent value between 0.76 and 7.29%, except for the first statement, which has a percent activity of 60.58% (a SELECT statement).</p>
<p>On the right hand side of the Detail for Selected 5 Minute Interval section is a Top Sessions table. The table has 4 columns, named Activity (%), Session ID, QC Session ID, User Name, and Program. For each session, the table shows Activity percent as a horizontal bar graph and a numeric value. There are 10 sessions displayed in the table. The first 9 sessions in the table represent background processes (P00n, J00n, CJQ0, and LGWR). The P00n processes belong to the SH user session. The last session listed in the table is for the program oraagent.bin@racnode2.example.com (TNS V1-V3).</p>
<p>Both above and below the Top SQL table on the left is a drop-down list labeled Actions, with the value Schedule SQL Tuning Advisor currently selected. Next to this drop-down list is a Go button. At the top of the Top SQL table are two hyperlinks: Select All and Select None. Below the Top SQL table, on the right hand side, is the text "Total Sample Count: 1,715".</p>
<p>At the top of the Top Sessions table is a drop-down list labeled View, with the value Top Sessions currently selected. Above the Top Sessions table, on the right hand side, is a button labeled Run ASH Report. Below the Top Sessions table on the right hand side is the text "Total Sample Count: 1,812".</p>
