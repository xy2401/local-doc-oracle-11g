<p>This figure illustrates a single-instance, nonclustered Oracle Database configuration that includes an Oracle ASM instance and a pool of storage. Starting at the top of the figure, a box is labeled "Oracle Database Instance" and below that is another box labeled "ASM Instance" and to the left of these boxes is another label "Single-Instance Database (Nonclustered)." To the right of the box that represents the Oracle ASM Instance are four more boxes that are connected to each other and also to the Oracle ASM Instance box to signify that this configuration uses these particular Oracle high availability features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oracle Automatic Storage Management—Fault-Tolerant Storage Scale-Out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flashback Technologies—Correct errors by reviewing past transactions, and changes, undoing transactions and rewinding tables and database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online Redefinition—Redefine Tables Online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery Manager and Oracle Secure Backup—Low-Cost, High-Performance Data Protection and Archiving</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom of the figure, directly below the "ASM Instance" box, is a picture of a single server with a line connecting the server to a row of disks with the label "Pool of Storage." The six disks in the pool of storage are contained in a dotted-line box. Within this dotted-line box, the two leftmost disks are labeled "Database Area" and the four disks to right are labeled "Fast Recovery Area."</p>
