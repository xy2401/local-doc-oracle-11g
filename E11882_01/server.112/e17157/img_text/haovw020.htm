<title>Description of the illustration haovw020.gif</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This figure is similar to and is a companion of the previous cold cluster failover figure, because this figure illustrates the same multi-instance, clustered architecture after a failover has occurred.</p>
<p>Starting at the top of the figure, two servers are in a box (outlined with a dotted line) that is labeled "Application/Web Servers."</p>
<p>To the left of the servers is another label: "Applications and Web Servers Managed with Oracle Clusterware API." Both servers are connected to another box labeled "Oracle Net Services Client Access" and this box shows separate connections to two nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Node 1 is not in a box and is outlined with a dotted line and crossed out with an X to indicate that this node and instance are in standby mode. The node is not actively servicing application requests for this database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node 2 is in an orange box and is also connected by a line to the "Pool of Storage" below, to indicate that the instance is actively servicing database requests from the applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the left of the nodes is another label: "Single-Instance Oracle Database Made Highly Available with Oracle Clusterware." A dotted line runs between Node 1 to Node 2 to indicate a heartbeat connection between the nodes.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the figure, directly below the nodes is a single a row of disks with the label "Pool of Storage." The six disks in the pool of storage are contained in a dotted-line box. Within this dotted-line box, the two leftmost disks are labeled "Database Area" and the four disks to right are labeled "Fast Recovery Area."</p>
