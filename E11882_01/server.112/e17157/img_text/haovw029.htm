<p>This figure shows two parallel configurations (old and new), both of which are running Oracle Data Guard with a production (primary) database and a standby database. Both configurations also show the Oracle Data Guard redo transport mechanism continuously shipping, validating, and applying redo data from the primary database to the standby database.</p>
<p>On the standby site in the old environment, the Oracle Data Guard standby database is protecting the primary database while at the same time the standby is hosting the GoldenGate capture process such that changes are captured from redo logs on the standby database and replicated over multiple parallel streams to a GoldenGate target in the new environment. Replication is shown using a layer of processing for each of thee processes: capture, source trail, target trail, and delivery</p>
