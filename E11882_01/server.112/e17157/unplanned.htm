<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.4</span> Oracle Real Application Clusters and Oracle Clusterware</h2>
<p>Oracle RAC and Oracle Clusterware allow Oracle Database to run any packaged or custom application across a set of clustered servers. This capability provides the highest levels of availability and the most flexible scalability. If a clustered server fails, then Oracle Database continues running on the surviving servers. When more processing power is needed, you can add another server without interrupting access to data.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oracle RAC</span> enables multiple instances that are linked by an interconnect to share access to an Oracle database. In an Oracle RAC environment, Oracle Database runs on two or more systems in a cluster while concurrently accessing a single shared database. The result is a single database system that spans multiple hardware systems, enabling Oracle RAC to provide high availability and redundancy during failures in the cluster. Oracle RAC accommodates all system types, from read-only data warehouse systems to update-intensive online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Oracle Clusterware</span> is software that, when installed on servers running the same operating system, enables the servers to be bound together to operate as if they are one server, and manages the availability of user applications and Oracle databases. Oracle Clusterware also provides all of the features required for cluster management, including node membership, group services, global resource management, and high availability functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For high availability, you can place Oracle databases (single-instance or Oracle RAC databases), and user applications (Oracle and non-Oracle) under the management and protection of Oracle Clusterware so that the databases and applications restart when a process fails or so that a failover to another node occurs after a node failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For cluster management, Oracle Clusterware presents multiple independent servers as if they are a single-system image or one virtual server. This single virtual server is preserved across the cluster for all management operations, enabling administrators to perform installations, configurations, backups, upgrades, and monitoring functions. Then, Oracle Clusterware automatically distributes the execution of these management functions to the appropriate nodes in the cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle Clusterware is a requirement for using Oracle RAC. Oracle Clusterware is the only clusterware that you need for most platforms on which Oracle RAC operates. Although Oracle Database continues to support third-party clusterware products on specified platforms, using Oracle Clusterware provides these main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dispenses with proprietary vendor clusterware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses an integrated software stack from Oracle that provides disk management with Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) to data management with Oracle Database and Oracle RAC</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Oracle Database features, such as Oracle Service, use the underlying Oracle Clusterware mechanisms to provide their capabilities.</p>
<p>Oracle Clusterware requires two clusterware components: a voting disk to record node membership information and the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) to record cluster configuration information. The voting disk and the OCR must reside on shared storage. Oracle Clusterware requires that each node be connected to a private network over a private interconnect.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically restarts failed Oracle processes.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically restarts resources from failed nodes on surviving nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controls Oracle processes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Oracle RAC databases, Oracle Clusterware controls all Oracle processes by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Oracle single-instance databases, Oracle Clusterware allows you to configure the Oracle processes into a resource group that is under the control of Oracle Clusterware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides an application programming interface (API) for Oracle and non-Oracle applications that enables you to control other Oracle processes with Oracle Clusterware, such as restart or react to failures and certain rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manages node membership and prevents split-brain syndrome in which two or more instances attempt to control the database.</p>

The consolidated databases reap the high availability benefits of failover protection, online rolling patch application, and rolling upgrades for the operating system and Oracle Clusterware.</p>
<p>Oracle RAC One Node enables better availability than cold failover for single-instance databases because of the Oracle technology called <span class="italic">online database relocation</span>, which intelligently migrates database instances and connections to other cluster nodes for high availability and load balancing.

<p>Oracle Data Guard ensures high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery for enterprise data. Oracle Data Guard provides a comprehensive set of services that create, maintain, manage, and monitor one or more standby databases to enable Oracle databases to survive disasters and data corruptions. Oracle Data Guard maintains standby databases as transactionally consistent copies of the primary (production) database. Then, if the primary database becomes unavailable because of a planned or an unplanned outage, Oracle Data Guard can switch any standby database to the primary role, minimizing the downtime associated with the outage. Oracle Data Guard can be used with traditional backup, restoration, and cluster techniques to provide a high level of data protection and data availability.With Oracle Data Guard, administrators can optionally improve primary database performance by off-loading resource-intensive backup and reporting operations to standby systems.<a id="sthref96"></a></p>
<p>A Oracle Data Guard configuration consists of one primary database and one or more standby databases. A primary database can be either a single-instance Oracle database or an Oracle RAC database. Using a backup copy of the primary database, you can create up to 30 standby databases and incorporate them in a Oracle Data Guard configuration. After the database is created, Oracle Data Guard automatically maintains each standby database by transmitting redo data from the primary database and then applying the redo data to the standby database.</p>
<p>Similar to a primary database, a standby database can be either a single-instance Oracle database or an Oracle RAC database.</p>
<p>A standby database can be a physical standby database, a snapshot standby database, a logical standby database, a transient logical standby database, or Oracle Active Data Guard. An Oracle Data Guard configuration can include any combination of these types of standby databases.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.6.1</span> Physical Standby Databases</h3>
<p>A physical standby database provides a physically identical copy of the primary database, with data files that are identical to the primary database. The database schemas, including indexes, are the same. A physical standby database is kept synchronized with the primary database, through Redo Apply, which recovers the redo data received from the primary database and applies the redo data to the physical standby database.</p>
<p>You can employ a physical standby database for business purposes other than disaster recovery. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a physical standby database for read-only access while redo data is being applied to the standby database. This mode is referred to as the Oracle Active Data Guard option or real-time query, and allows users access to an up-to-date physical standby database while still providing disaster recovery and data protection for the Oracle Database. See <a href="#BABEGIFA">Section 3.6.2</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use a physical standby database to <a id="sthref102"></a>offload the overhead of performing backups from the primary database. This is possible because a physical standby is an exact copy of the primary database.</p>

<p>Oracle Active Data Guard is Oracle's strategic feature for data protection and disaster recovery for the Oracle database.</p>
<p>Oracle Active Data Guard, which is an option built on the infrastructure of Oracle Data Guard, allows a physical standby database to be open read-only while changes are applied to it from the primary database. This enables read-only applications to use the physical standby with minimal latency between the data on the standby database and that on the primary database, even while processing very high transaction volumes at the primary database. This is sometimes referred to as real-time query.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The "real-time query" feature of Oracle Active Data Guard enables a physical standby database to be opened read-only while Redo Apply is active. Oracle Active Data Guard is packaged as a separate database option for Oracle Enterprise Edition. It requires a license for production database and all of the physical standby databases that are used for the Oracle Active Data Guard option.</div>
<p>An Oracle Active Data Guard standby database is used for automatic repair of data corruptions detected by the primary database, transparent to the application. In the event of an unplanned outage on the primary database, high availability is maintained by quickly failing over to the standby database. An Active Data Guard standby database can also be used to off-load fast incremental backups from the primary database given that it is a block-for-block physical replica of the primary.</p>

<p>The MAA recommended best practice for performing rolling database upgrades is to use a transient logical standby database<a id="sthref114"></a><a id="sthref115"></a><a id="sthref116"></a><a id="sthref117"></a><a id="sthref118"></a> and a Bourne shell script (developed by Oracle) that automates database rolling upgrades to new Oracle patch sets or full database releases. The database rolling upgrade is performed using an existing Data Guard physical standby database and the transient logical standby rolling upgrade process.</p>
<p>The <a id="sthref119"></a><a id="sthref120"></a><a id="sthref121"></a><a id="sthref122"></a>Bourne shell script, named physru, greatly reduces the complexity of executing a rolling database upgrade by automating most of the upgrade steps. The script provides many benefits including the ability to handle upgrades for both Oracle RAC and single-instance database. Although the physru script automates upgrade tasks, it is subject to the same prerequisites and limitations as the manual process for executing a transient logical database rolling upgrade. For example, you may need to implement <a id="sthref123"></a><a id="sthref124"></a><a id="sthref125"></a>Extended Data Type Support (EDS) to accommodate advanced data types.</p>

<p>Transient logical standby databases provide the following overall benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It allows you to apply and test changes on a completely separate system and database prior to switching the production application and clients over to the upgraded system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It greatly improves availability by eliminating planned downtime required for many of the usual tasks associated with a conventional database upgrade, including PL/SQL recompilation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It employs existing physical standby databases for database rolling upgrades; there is no additional storage or effort required to deploy a separate logical standby database for the sole purpose of a rolling upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requires executing only a single catalog upgrade to migrate both primary and standby databases to a new Oracle release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows for additional validation of the upgrade and the system before switching applications and clients to the new environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the upgrade process is complete, the primary database and physical standby database are both running the new Oracle release.</p>

<p>A snapshot standby database is a physical standby database that you temporarily convert into an updatable standby database. You can use snapshot standby databases as clones or test databases to validate new functionality and new releases, and when finished you then convert the database back into a physical standby. While running in the snapshot standby database role, it continues to receive and queue redo data so that data protection and the RPO are not sacrificed.</p>
<p>A snapshot standby database receives and archives redo data from the primary database&mdash;protecting data on the primary database at all times&mdash;but the snapshot standby database does not apply redo data from the primary database while the standby is open for read/write access. Thus, the snapshot standby typically diverges from the primary database over time. Redo Apply does not apply the redo data until you convert the snapshot standby database back into a physical standby database, and all local updates that were made to the snapshot standby database are discarded. Although the local updates to the snapshot standby database cause additional divergence, the data in the primary database is fully protected by the redo log that is located at the standby site.</p>
<p>With a single command, you can revert a snapshot standby to a physical standby database, at which time the changes made to the snapshot standby state are discarded, and Redo Apply automatically resynchronizes the physical standby database with the primary database using the redo data that was archived.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="HAOVW11833"></a>Benefits of Snapshot Standby Databases<a id="sthref130"></a></p>
<p>Snapshot standby databases provide the following overall benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inherit all the attributes of a physical standby database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be open for read/write I/O and can process transactions independent of the primary database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect the primary database the entire time it is open for read-write I/O</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow you to issue a single command to convert a snapshot standby back to a synchronized physical standby database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an ideal test system, especially when combined with Oracle Real Application Testing</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.6.5</span> Logical Standby Databases<a id="sthref132"></a></h3>
<p>A logical standby database contains the same logical information as the primary database, although the physical organization and structure of the data can be different. The logical standby database is kept synchronized with the primary database through <a id="sthref133"></a>SQL Apply, which transforms the redo data received from the primary database into SQL statements and then executes the SQL statements on the standby database.</p>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="HAOVW11835"></a>Benefits of Logical Standby Databases<a id="sthref134"></a></p>
<p>Logical standby databases provide the following overall benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A key benefit of a logical standby database is that you can create significant auxiliary structures to optimize the reporting workload, including structures that could have a prohibitive effect on the transactional response time of the primary database. A logical standby database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can have its data physically reorganized into a different storage type with different partitioning having many different indexes, and having on-demand refresh materialized views created and maintained. See <a class="olink CNCPT" href="../e40540/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Concepts</span></a> for an overview of materialized views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be used to drive the creation of data cubes and other OLAP data views. See <a class="olink OLAAP" href="../../olap.112/e10795/toc.htm"><span class="italic">Oracle OLAP Java API Developer's Guide</span></a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be used for other business purposes in addition to satisfying disaster recovery requirements, allowing users to access a logical standby database for queries and reporting purposes at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be used to upgrade Oracle Database software and patch sets with almost no downtime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, you can use a logical standby database concurrently for data protection, reporting, and database upgrades.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.7.1</span> About Oracle GoldenGate</h3>
<p>Oracle GoldenGate is an asynchronous, log-based, real-time data replication product that moves high volumes of transactional data in real-time across heterogeneous database, hardware, and operating system environments with minimal impact.</p>
<p>A typical environment includes a capture, pump and delivery process. Each of these processes can run on most of the popular operating systems and databases, including Oracle Database and non-Oracle databases. All or a portion of the data may be replicated, and the data within any of these processes may be manipulated for not only heterogeneous environments but also different database schemas. Oracle GoldenGate supports <a id="sthref144"></a><a id="sthref145"></a><a id="sthref146"></a>multimaster replication, hub-and-spoke deployment, and data transformation. Thus, Oracle GoldenGate enables you to ensure that your critical systems are operational 24/7, and the associated data is distributed across the enterprise to optimize decision making.</p>
<p>Oracle GoldenGate is also an excellent method to minimize downtime during planned maintenance, including application and database upgrades, in addition to platform migrations.</p>

<p>Oracle Golden Gate and Oracle Active Data Guard are strategic capabilities within Oracle's software portfolio and are complementary to each other. When used together, Oracle GoldenGate and Oracle Active Data Guard offer a unique data protection and information distribution solution not offered by any other product.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Oracle GoldenGate is an Oracle product sold independently of the Oracle Database for Oracle and third-party database management systems. It is available for both Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and Oracle Database Standard Edition. A license for Oracle GoldenGate includes a license for Oracle Active Data Guard.</div>
<p>While these features generally fall into the category of replication technologies, each has a very different area of focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oracle Active Data Guard is Oracle's strategic product for data protection and disaster recovery for Oracle Database.</p>
<p>Oracle Active Data Guard is a superset of standard Data Guard functionality included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition, thus Active Data Guard also inherits all Data Guard functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transparent operation across all data types, storage attributes, DML and DDL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management simplicity; simple one-way replication of the entire database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superior corruption protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choice of asynchronous or synchronous (zero data loss) protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High availability during unplanned events via automatic database and client failover</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimized downtime by implementing database upgrades, system and site maintenance, or technology refresh, in rolling fashion across primary and standby databases</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle Active Data Guard requires a separate license and can only be used with Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. It can be purchased as the Active Data Guard Option for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. It is also included with Oracle GoldenGate. Basic Data Guard functionality does not require a separate license, and it is included with Oracle Enterprise Edition. Oracle Active Data Guard is described in <a href="#BABEGIFA">Section 3.6.2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle GoldenGate is Oracle's strategic product for data distribution and data integration.</p>
<p>Oracle GoldenGate supplements Active Data Guard with its heterogeneous and bidirectional replication capabilities to enable enterprise-wide information distribution, zero-downtime upgrades and migrations, query offloading to heterogeneous systems, and multimaster database solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the business situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose Oracle Active Data Guard for a simple, high-performance, drop-in solution for disaster recovery, data protection, and high availability for the entire Oracle database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose Oracle GoldenGate to set up a data distribution and data synchronization solution through this Oracle-Oracle replication configuration, or a more flexible multimaster HA solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#BABHHABE">Figure 3-1</a> shows a configuration in which an Oracle Data Guard physical standby database provides optimal data protection and offloads read-only workload from the primary database. It also provides for heterogeneous replication of various subsets of the production database to multiple target databases. Rather than host Oracle GoldenGate replication on the production database, the Oracle GoldenGate capture process is offloaded to the physical standby database where changes are captured from archived redo logs and replicated, without necessitating overhead for Oracle GoldenGate processing on the production system.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.8</span> Oracle Flashback Technology<a id="ABC39676410"></a></h2>
<p>Flashback technology provides a set of features to switch between views of the data as it existed at different points in time. Using flashback features, you can query past versions of schema objects and historical data. You can also perform change analysis and self-service repair to recover from logical corruption while the database is online.</p>
<p>Flashback technology provides a SQL interface to quickly analyze and repair human errors. Flashback technology provides fine-grained analysis and repair for localized damage such as deleting the wrong customer order. Flashback technology also enables correction of more widespread damage, yet does it quickly to avoid long downtime. Flashback technology is unique to Oracle Database and supports recovery at all levels including row, transaction, table, tablespace, and database.</p>
<p>Most of the flashback features use undo data, whereas other features (such as Flashback Database and Block Media Recovery) use flashback logs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Undo tablespace<a id="sthref151"></a>&mdash;A dedicated tablespace that stores only undo information when the database is run in automatic undo management mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flashback Data Archive&mdash;An archive that is stored in a tablespace and contains transactional changes to every record in a table for the duration of the record's lifetime. The archived data can be retained for much longer duration than the retention period offered by an undo tablespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flashback log<a id="sthref152"></a>s&mdash;Oracle-generated logs used to perform Flashback Database or block media recovery operations. The database can only write flashback logs to the fast recovery area. Flashback logs are written sequentially and are not archived. They cannot be backed up to disk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describes the Flashback features:</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.8.1</span> Oracle Flashback Query<a id="sthref154"></a></h3>
<p>Oracle Flashback Query provides the ability to view the data as it existed in the past by using the Automatic Undo Management system to obtain metadata and historical data for transactions. Undo data is persistent and survives a database malfunction or shutdown. The unique features of Flashback Query not only provide the ability to query previous versions of tables, they also provide a powerful mechanism to recover from erroneous operations.</p>
<p>Uses of Flashback Query include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recovering lost data or undoing incorrect, committed changes. For example, rows that have been deleted or updated can be immediately repaired even after they have been committed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing current data with the corresponding data at some time in the past. For example, by using a daily report that shows the changes in data from yesterday, it is possible to compare individual rows of table data, or find intersections or unions of sets of rows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking the state of transactional data at a particular time, such as verifying the account balance on a certain day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplifying application design by removing the need to store certain types of temporal data. By using a Flashback Query, it is possible to retrieve past data directly from the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying packaged applications, such as report generation tools, to past data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing self-service error correction for an application, enabling users to undo and correct their errors.</p>

<p>Oracle Flashback Version Query<a id="sthref156"></a> is an extension to SQL that you can use to retrieve the versions of rows in a given table that existed in a specific time interval. Oracle Flashback Version Query returns a row for each version of the row that existed in the specified time interval. For any given table, a new row version is created each time the <code>COMMIT</code> statement is executed.</p>
<p>Oracle Flashback Version Query is a powerful tool that database administrators (DBAs) can use to run analysis to determine the source of problems. Additionally, application developers can use Oracle Flashback Version Query to build customized applications for auditing purposes.</p>

<p>Oracle Flashback Transaction<a id="sthref158"></a><a id="sthref159"></a><a id="sthref160"></a><a id="sthref161"></a> backs out a transaction and its dependent transactions. The <a id="sthref162"></a><code>DBMS_FLASHBACK.TRANSACTION_BACKOUT()</code> procedure rolls back a transaction and its dependent transactions while the database remains online. This recovery operation uses undo data to create and execute the compensating transactions that return the affected data to its original state. You can query the <a id="sthref163"></a><code>DBA_FLASHBACK_TRANSACTION_STATE</code> view to see whether the transaction has been backed out using dependency rules or forced out by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backing out nonconflicting rows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying undo SQL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle Flashback Transaction increases availability during logical recovery by quickly backing out a specific transaction or set of transactions and their dependent transactions. You use one command to back out transactions while the database remains online.</p>

<p>Oracle Flashback Table<a id="sthref167"></a> recovers a table to a previous point in time. It provides a fast, online solution for recovering a table or set of tables that has been modified by a human or application error. In most cases, Oracle Flashback Table alleviates the need for administrators to perform more complicated point-in-time recovery operations. The data in the original table is not lost when you use Oracle Flashback Table because you can return the table to its original state.</p>

<p>Dropping objects by accident is a problem for database users and database administrators alike. Although there is no easy way to recover dropped tables, indexes, constraints, or triggers, Oracle Flashback Drop<a id="sthref169"></a> provides a safety net when you are dropping objects. When you drop a table, it is automatically placed into the Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin is a virtual container where all dropped objects reside. You can continue to query data in a dropped table.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.8.7</span> Oracle Flashback Restore Points</h3>
<p>When an Oracle Flashback recovery operation is performed on the database, the DBA must determine the point in time&mdash;identified by the system change number (SCN) or time stamp&mdash;to which you can later flash back the data. Oracle Flashback restore points<a id="sthref171"></a> are labels that you can define to substitute for the SCN or transaction time used in Flashback Database, Flashback Table, and Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) operations. Furthermore, a database can be flashed back through a previous database recovery and opened as with an <code>OPEN RESETLOGS</code> command by using guaranteed restore points. Guaranteed restore points allow major database changes&mdash;such as database batch jobs, upgrades, or patches&mdash;to be quickly undone by ensuring that the undo required to rewind the database is retained.</p>
<p>Using the Oracle Flashback restore points feature provides the following benefits:</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">3.8.8</span> Oracle Flashback Database</h3>
<p>Oracle Flashback Database<a id="sthref173"></a> provides a more efficient alternative to database point-in-time recovery. With Oracle Flashback Database, you can revert current data files to their contents at a past time. The result is much like restoring data from data file backups and executing point-in-time database recovery. However, Flashback Database skips the data file restoration and most of the application of redo data.</p>
<p>Enabling Oracle Flashback Database provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to eliminate the time to restore a backup when fixing human error that has a database-wide impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to quickly undo human errors by using real-time apply to synchronize the standby database with the primary database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to quickly reinstantiate the standby database after a database failover.</p>

<p>After attempting to automatically repair corrupted blocks, block media recovery can optionally retrieve a more recent copy of a data block from the flashback logs to reduce recovery time. <a id="sthref179"></a>Automatic block repair allows corrupt blocks on the primary database to be automatically repaired as soon as they are detected, by using good blocks from a physical standby database.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a corrupted block encountered during instance recovery does not result in instance recovery failure. The block is automatically marked as corrupt and added to the RMAN corruption list in the <code>V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION</code> table. You can subsequently issue the RMAN <code>RECOVER BLOCK</code> command to fix the associated block. In addition, the RMAN <code>RECOVER BLOCK</code> command restores blocks from a physical standby database, if it is available.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.9</span> Oracle Automatic Storage Management</h2>
<p><a id="sthref183"></a><a id="sthref184"></a>Oracle ASM provides a vertically integrated file system and volume manager directly in the Oracle Database kernel, resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Significantly less work to provision database storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher level of availability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elimination of the expense, installation, and maintenance of specialized storage products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique capabilities for database applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For optimal performance, Oracle ASM spreads files across all available storage. To protect against data loss, Oracle ASM extends the concept of SAME (stripe and mirror everything) and adds more flexibility as it can mirror at the database file level rather than at the entire disk level.</p>
<p>More importantly, Oracle ASM simplifies the processes of setting up mirroring, adding disks, and removing disks. Instead of managing hundreds or possibly thousands of files (as in a large data warehouse), DBAs using Oracle ASM create and administer a larger-grained object called a <span class="bold"><a id="sthref185"></a>disk group</span>. The disk group identifies the set of disks that are managed as a logical unit. Automation of file naming and placement of the underlying database files save administrators time and ensure adherence to standard best practices.</p>
<p>The <a id="sthref186"></a><a id="sthref187"></a><a id="sthref188"></a>Oracle ASM native mirroring mechanism (two-way or three-way) protects against storage failures. With Oracle ASM mirroring, you can provide an additional level of data protection with the use of failure groups. A <span class="italic"><a id="sthref189"></a>failure group</span> is a set of disks sharing a common resource (disk controller or an entire disk array) whose failure can be tolerated. After it is defined, an <a id="sthref190"></a><a id="sthref191"></a>Oracle ASM failure group intelligently places redundant copies of the data in separate failure groups. This ensures that the data is available and transparently protected against the failure of any component in the storage subsystem.</p>
<p>By using Oracle ASM, you can<a id="sthref192"></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mirror and stripe across drives and storage arrays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically remirror from a failed drive to remaining drives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically rebalance stored data when disks are added or removed while the database remains online</p>

<p>The <a id="sthref197"></a><span class="bold">fast recovery area</span> is a unified storage location for all recovery-related files and activities in Oracle Database. After this feature is enabled, all RMAN backups, archived redo log files, control file autobackups, flashback logs, and data file copies are automatically written to a specified file system or Oracle ASM disk group, and the management of this disk space is handled by RMAN and the database server.</p>
<p>Performing a backup to disk is faster because using the fast recovery area eliminates the bottleneck of writing to tape. More importantly, if database media recovery is required, then data file backups are readily available. Restoration and recovery time is reduced because you do not need to find a tape and a free tape device to restore the needed data files and archived redo log files.</p>
<p>The fast recovery area provides the following benefits<a id="sthref198"></a>:</p>

<p>You can use Data Recovery Advisor to troubleshoot primary databases, logical standby databases, and snapshot standby databases.</p>
<p>Data Recovery Advisor includes the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Failure diagnosis</p>
<p>The first symptoms of database failure are usually error messages, alarms, trace files and dumps, and failed health checks. Assessing these symptoms can be complicated, error-prone, and time-consuming. Data Recovery Advisor automatically diagnoses data failures and informs you about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure impact assessment</p>
<p>After a failure is diagnosed, you must understand its extent and assess its impact on applications before devising a repair strategy. Data Recovery Advisor automatically assesses the impact of a failure and displays it in an easily understood format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repair generation</p>
<p>Even if a failure has been diagnosed correctly, selecting the right repair strategy can be error-prone and stressful. Moreover, there is often a high penalty for making poor decisions in terms of increased downtime and loss of data. Data Recovery Advisor automatically determines the best repair for a set of failures and presents it to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repair feasibility checks</p>
<p>Before presenting repair options, Data Recovery Advisor validates them with respect to the specific environment and availability of media components required to complete the proposed repair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repair automation</p>
<p>If you accept the suggested repair option, Data Recovery Advisor automatically performs the repair, verifies that the repair was successful, and closes the appropriate failures.</p>
</li>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.18</span> Oracle Database File System (DBFS)<a id="sthref225"></a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Oracle Database File System (DBFS)</span> creates a standard file system interface on top of files and directories that are stored in database tables. Oracle DBFS is similar to the Network File System (NFS) protocol in that it provides a shared network file system that looks like a local file system.</p>
<p>Similar to NFS, there is a server component and a client component. The server is Oracle Database and files are stored as <a id="sthref226"></a>SecureFile LOBs in a database table. Because the files are stored in the database you inherit the high availability and disaster-recovery protection Oracle Database offers, providing a full stack disaster-recovery solution. The implementation of the file system in the database is called the <a id="sthref227"></a>DBFS Content Store and allows each database user to create one or more file systems that can be mounted by clients. Each file system has its own dedicated tables that hold the file system content. A set of PL/SQL procedures implement file system access (such as <code>CREATE</code>, <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>LIST</code> <code>DIRECTORY)</code> to the database.</p>
<p>Oracle DBFS provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ability to store both non-structured and structured data in the same database.</p>
<p>This allows you to perform backups and synchronous point-in-time recovery of both types of data.</p>
<p>Oracle DBFS provides the ability to store unstructured content in the database by presenting an NFS-like file system to the client. The file system itself is stored in a tablespace in Oracle Database. The database storage aspect is transparent to the client because it appears as a traditional NFS mounted file system with the same functionality, but DBFS provides the ability to store any type of file directly in the database&mdash;such as logs or generated reports&mdash;that you would normally store in a file system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clustered file system capability with a lightweight process.</p>
<p>You can mount Oracle DBFS on multiple client machines (database servers, mid-tiers) and therefore the file system can also be available for use as a clustered file system. A lightweight process is started on each client machine to make the file system accessible. This process uses the <a id="sthref228"></a>FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) API to implement the file system access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast and transparent client failover of both file system and database operations (full stack disaster recovery).</p>
<p>The process on the client systems is OCI based. Thus, clients can take advantage of FAN and Fast Connection Failover capabilities using the same service-based connection methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.19</span> Client Failove<a id="sthref229"></a>r</h2>
<p>A highly available architecture requires the ability of the application tier to transparently fail over to a surviving instance or database advertising the required service. This ensures that applications are generally available or minimally impacted in the event of node failure, instance failure, data corruption, or database failures. Transparent client failover allows applications to fail over to another available Oracle RAC instance or to another database (such as in the case of an Oracle Data Guard role transition).</p>
<p>Client failover encompasses failure notification, connection cleanup, automatic reconnection and retries of database service residing in another Oracle RAC instance or database and possibly query retry.</p>
<p>For client failover best practices and network best practices, see the MAA white paper "Client Failover Best Practices for Data Guard 11g Release 2" from the MAA Best Practices area for Oracle Database at</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">3.20</span> Automatic Block Repair<a id="sthref230"></a></h2>
<p><span class="bold">Automatic block repair</span> allows corrupt <a id="sthref231"></a><a id="sthref232"></a><a id="sthref233"></a><a id="sthref234"></a><a id="sthref235"></a>data blocks to be automatically repaired as soon as the corruption is detected. This feature reduces the amount of time that data is inaccessible due to block corruption. This reduces block recovery time by using up-to-date good blocks in real-time, as opposed to retrieving blocks from disk or tape backups, or from Flashback logs.</p>
<p>Automatic block repair requires the use of the Oracle Active Data Guard option so that you can open a physical standby database for read-write I/O. Also, note that this feature requires that Oracle Data Guard is running in maximum availability mode and has the <code>LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n</code> initialization parameter set to the <code>SYNC</code> redo transport mode.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The "real-time query" feature of Oracle Active Data Guard enables a physical standby database to be opened read-only while Redo Apply is active. Oracle Active Data Guard is packaged as a separate database option for Oracle Enterprise Edition. It requires a license for production database and all of the physical standby databases that are used for the Oracle Active Data Guard option.</div>

<p>The MAA recommended way to achieve the most comprehensive data corruption prevention and detection is to use Oracle Data Guard and configure the <code>DB_BLOCK_CHECKING</code>, <code>DB_BLOCK_CHECKSUM</code>, and <code>DB_LOST_WRITE_PROTECT</code> database initialization parameters on the Data Guard primary and standby databases.</p>
<p>Oracle Data Guard is the best solution for protecting Oracle data against data loss and corruption, and lost writes. It is the only Oracle feature that maintains one or more standby databases to protect enterprise data against failures, disasters, errors, and data corruptions. With Data Guard, you can deploy and manage one or more standby copies of the primary (production) database in the local data center or in a remote data center. All the advantages of data protection derive from this fact.</p>
<p>For example, you can use Data Guard to maintain another copy of your data on a standby database that is continuously updated with changes from the production database. Data Guard validates all changes before they are applied to the standby database, preventing physical corruptions from propagating and corrupting the physical standby database. The standby database can be activated if the production database should become unavailable due to site disasters, data corruption, or human error.</p>
<p>Starting in Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2), the primary database automatically attempts to repair the corrupted block in real time by fetching a good version of the same block from a physical standby database. Moreover, the Oracle Active Data Guard option, a feature that enables a physical standby database to be opened read-only while Redo Apply is active, is required for automatic block repair. This feature allows corrupt data blocks to be automatically repaired as soon as the corruption is detected. For more information, see the "Automatic Block Repair" section in this white paper.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Exadata Cell is another comprehensive solution to prevent corruptions from being written to disk. It can detect corruption early and prevent corrupted data from being written to disk. See <a href="#BABIBEEI">Section 3.16</a> for more information about Exadata Cell.</div>
<p>Before Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, block corruptions detected by RMAN were recorded in <code><a id="sthref244"></a>V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION</code>. Beginning with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, several database components and utilities in addition to RMAN can detect a corrupt block and record it in that view. Oracle Database automatically updates this view when block corruptions are detected or repaired (for example, using block media recovery or data file recovery). Block corruptions are now discovered sooner.</p>
<p>By making it possible to detect data corruptions in a timely manner, these features provide critical high availability benefits for Oracle Database.</p>
