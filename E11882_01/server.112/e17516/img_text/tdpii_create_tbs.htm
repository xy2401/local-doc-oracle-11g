<ul>

The Permanent option has an accompanying check box named <span class="bold">Set as default permanent tablespace</span>. Similarly, the Temporary option has an accompanying check box named <span class="bold">Set as default temporary tablespace</span>. The Undo option has an accompanying set of options named <span class="bold">Undo Retention Guarantee</span>. The options are Yes and No.</p>
