<p>This screenshot shows the Setup Downstream Capture page. At the top of the page are the Cancel and OK buttons. Under the buttons on the right side of the page is an Overview section with the following text: "A real-time downstream capture works the following way</p>
<p>Redo Transport services use the logwrite process (LGWR) at the source database to send the redo data to the downstream database.</p>
<p>A Remote file server process (RFS) at the downstream database receives the redo data over the network and stored the data in the standby redo log.</p>
<p>A log switch at the source database causes a log switch at the downstream database and the ARCHn process at the downstream database archives the current standby redo log file.</p>
<p>The real-time downstream process captures changes from the standby redolog whenever possible and the archived standby redolog files wherever necessary. A capture process can capture changes in the archived standby redolog files if it falls behind. When it catches up it resumes capturing changes from the standby redo log.</p>
<p>An archived log downstream capture process configuration means that archived log files from the database are copied to the downstream database, and the capture process captures changes in these archived redo log files. You can copy the archived redo log files to the downstream database using the redo transport services, the DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER package, file transfer protocol (FTP), or some other mechanism"</p>
<p>A Downstream Database Details section includes the following text: "The connected database will be considered as Source Database. Enter the database target name and the Streams Administrator credentials for the database on which the Downstream capture process is to be created."</p>
<p>The Downstream Database Details section also include the following text fields: Host Name, Port, SID or Service Name, Streams Administrator, and Password.</p>
<p>A Capture Process Details section includes the following fields: A Capture Process Name text field and a Real-Time Downstream Capture or Archived Log Downstream Capture choice. Real-Time Downstream Capture is selected. Under Archived Log Downstream Capture, the following two choices are in a gray font: Assign Log Implicitly or Assign Log explicitly. Assign Log implicitly is selected.</p>
<p>A Log Details section includes the following text: "This wizard will configure all of the necessary steps at the source database to enable redo shipping both for real-time and archived log downstream capture." The Log Details section also includes a Standby Redo Log file Location text field. Under the text field is the following text: "This is the local destination for archived redo log files written from the standby redo logs. Log files from a remote source database should be kept separate from local database log files. This location will also be used to add standby log file groups to the downstream database."</p>
<p>Under the text is a Configure Log Parameters for Downstream Capture choice that is selected. Under the choice is the following text: "LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n Parameter.This parameter will be used to configure redo transport services to use the log writer process (LGWR) to copy data from online redo log at the source database to the standby redolog at the downstream database."</p>
<p>Under the text is a Log Parameter list.</p>
