<p>This screenshot shows the Streams page. At the top of the page are the Cancel and Continue buttons. Under the buttons is a warning with the following text, "Oracle recommends that, prior to performing Streams Replication on databases in your configuration, you create a Streams Administrator user."</p>
<p>Under the text is the Setup Streams Replication option. This option includes the following sub-options:</p>
<p>"Replicate Whole Database" with the text "Setup replication for whole database."</p>
<p>"Replicate Schemas" with the text "Setup replication for selected schemas by excluding desired tables."</p>
<p>"Replicate Tablespaces" with the text "Setup replication for a selected set of table spaces."</p>
<p>"Replicate Tables" with the text "Setup replication for selected tables and specifying the rules."</p>
<p>Next is the Setup Downstream Capture option with the text, "Create downstream capture processes that can be used in replication by other databases."</p>
<p>Next is the Create Advanced Queue option with the text, "Create Advanced Queues that can be used by replication processes or any other processes."</p>
<p>Next is the Host Credentials section with the following text, "Operating System login credentials of the machine that runs the selected database." This section includes the Username and Password fields. Under these fields is a Save as Preferred Credential option.</p>
<p>On the right side of the page is an Overview section with the following text:</p>
<p>Using the Streams Replication Setup wizard you can setup the streams replication between two databases.</p>
<p>Replication can be setup for the Whole Database, selected table spaces, schemas or tables.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify objects to exclude from replication.</p>
<p>Downstream capture setup wizard helps to setup the capture and propagation processes on a different database from that of source database. These processes can be used in subsequent replication setup operations.</p>
<p>You can edit the replication setup scripts to fix any issues or use any advanced data import export mechanism.</p>
<p>You can create advanced queues, wizard helps to create the new queues for the messages that can be used by stream replication or any other processes.</p>
<p>You can execute the setup processes immediately or schedule for later.</p>
