<p>This screenshot shows the Topology subpage of the Manage Replication page. The top of the page has the following subpage links: Overview and Streams. Below the subpage links is a <span class="bold">Refresh</span> button, the last refresh date and time, and a View Data list.</p>
<p>Below the View Data list, text reads, "The Oracle Streams Topology shows the current database and the databases to which it propagates messages. Also, it shows databases that propagate messages to the current database to be applied locally."</p>
<p>Under the text on the top left-hand side of the page is an Overview window. This window shows a hub database icon connected to two SPOKE1... database icons and two SPOKE2... database icons. The hub database icon represents the current database. An arrow points from a SPOKE1... database icon to the hub database icon and another arrow points from the hub database icon to a SPOKE1... database icon. An arrow points from a SPOKE2... database icon to the hub database icon and another arrow points from the hub database icon to a SPOKE2... database icon. On the right side of the window is a series of boxes with a + sign on the top and a - sign on the bottom. The boxes are used to increase or decrease the size of the image in the right window.</p>
<p>Under the Overview window is a Selection Details window. This window contains the following text, "Global Database Name SPOKE1.EXAMP".</p>
<p>There is a window on the right that shows a large version of the images shown in the Overview window.</p>
