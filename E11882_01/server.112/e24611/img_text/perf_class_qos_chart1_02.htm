</head>
<body>
<p>The screenshot shows the top portion of the Performance Class Quality of Service page. There is a single chart in this screenshot, the Performance Satisfaction Metric chart. The y-axis measures Performance Satisfaction Metric (PSM)(%) with values from -80 to +80. The x-axis measures Time in intervals of five minutes.</p>
<p>The chart legend indicates that five performance classes are being monitored: Default_pc, sales_pc, erp_pc, hr_pc, and sales cart. Each performance class is represented in the chart by a different colored line. The Default_pc performance class has a line that is higher than any other performance class and the sales cart performance class has a line that is lower than any other performance class. The Default_pc line is constantly at 100, and the variation of the sales cart line is from 15 to -15. The lines rise and fall at irregular intervals.</p>
