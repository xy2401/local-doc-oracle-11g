<p>This is a screenshot of the Create User-Reported Problem page. The main feature of the page is a table of issue types. The table has these columns: Select, Issue type, Description, and Recommended Advisor. There are four rows, each showing a different issue type. Under the Recommended Advisor column are names of available advisors. The listed issue types and corresponding Recommended Advisors are: System Performance (ADDM), Query Performance (SQL Advisor), Resource Usage (Memory Advisor), and None of the Above. Each issue type has a description in the Description column.</p>
<p>Above the table are two buttons: Run Recommended Advisor, and Continue with Creation of Problem. At the top right-hand corner of the page is a Cancel button.</p>
