<p>This screenshot is very similar to the standard open-a-file dialog box that is found in Windows operating systems, except that this one is implemented in a browser. Small icons are shown to the left of each file or directory name. A page icon is shown next to files, and a folder icon is shown next to directories. Files and directories are shown in a table, with the following columns: Select, Name, Owner, Group, Size (KB), Last Modified Time (PST). Above the table is a Search field. To the right of this field is a Go button. Above the Search field is a Path field, which shows the currently selected path. Above that field, the current host name and host user name are shown. Next to the user name is a Change button. In the upper right-hand corner of the window there are two buttons, arranged from left to right: Cancel and Select.</p>
