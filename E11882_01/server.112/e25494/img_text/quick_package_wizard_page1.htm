<p>This is an image of the Create New Package page of the Quick Packaging wizard. At the top of the page is a progress bar that names all of the pages in the wizard, and indicates that you are on the first page. Below the progress bar and toward the right-hand side of the page are two buttons: Cancel and Next. Between the two buttons is the text Step 1 of 4. Below the buttons is a form that you fill in, with the following fields, arranged vertically: Package Name (with a default package name supplied), Package Description, Send to Oracle Support (with Yes and No options), My Oracle Support Username, My Oracle Support Password, Customer Support Identifier (CSI), Country (a list that currently shows the default country, the United States), and Create New Service Request (SR) (with Yes and No options).</p>
