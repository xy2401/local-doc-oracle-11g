<p>Table Orders. There are a group of tables below this text with the dates below the tables: Jan 2006, Feb 2006. To the right of this is the text: - RANGE(order_date), - Primary key order_id.</p>
<p>Table LINEITEMS. After this text is a group of tables, connected to the top group. It is no longer a duplicate as in the previous figure because one of the color columns is missing. The missing column matches the color of the "order_date" text: Jan 2006, Feb 2006. To the right of this is the text: - RANGE(order_date), - Foreign key order_id.</p>
<p>There are two arrows from the top group, one points down to the second set of tables, the other loops back up to the top group. PARTITION BY REFERENCE, - Partitioning key inherited through.</p>
