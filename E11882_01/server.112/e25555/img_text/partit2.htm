<p>This is a graphic of the Results for Task page after evaluating partitioning. At the top left of the page is Overall Workload Performance. Beneath that is Potential for Improvement. Then there are two graphs. The graph on the left shows a Workload I/O Cost with the original cost being twice the new cost. The graph on the right shows Query Execution Time Improvement, with a potential improvement of 4x, 6x, or greater than 10x.</p>
