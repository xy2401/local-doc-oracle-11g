<h1 class="chapter"><span class="secnum">16</span> Application and Networking Architecture</h1>
<p>This chapter defines application architecture and describes how an Oracle database and database applications work in a distributed processing environment. This material applies to almost every type of Oracle Database environment.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Overview of Client/Server Architecture</h3>
<p><a id="sthref1942"></a><a id="sthref1943"></a>In <a id="sthref1944"></a>the Oracle Database environment, the database application and the database are separated into a <span class="bold">client/server architecture</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">client</span> runs the database application, for example, SQL*Plus or a Visual Basic data entry program, that accesses database information and interacts with a user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">server</span> runs the Oracle Database software and handles the functions required for concurrent, shared data access to an Oracle database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the client application and database can run on the same computer, greater efficiency is often achieved when the client portions and server portion are run by different computers connected through a network. The following sections discuss variations in the Oracle Database client/server architecture.</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Distributed Processing</h4>
<p>Using multiple hosts to process an individual task is known as <a href="glossary.htm#CHDFEJHE"><span class="xrefglossterm">distributed processing</span></a>. Front-end and back-end processing occurs on different computers. In <a href="#i7696">Figure 16-1</a>, the client and server are located on different hosts connected through Oracle Net Services.</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Advantages of a Client/Server Architecture</h4>
<p>Oracle Database client/server architecture in a distributed processing environment provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client applications are not responsible for performing data processing. Rather, they request input from users, request data from the server, and then analyze and present this data using the display capabilities of the client workstation or the terminal (for example, using graphics or spreadsheets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client applications are not dependent on the physical location of the data. Even if the data is moved or distributed to other database servers, the application continues to function with little or no modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Database exploits the multitasking and shared-memory facilities of its underlying operating system. As a result, it delivers the highest possible degree of concurrency, data integrity, and performance to its client applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client workstations or terminals can be optimized for the presentation of data (for example, by providing graphics and mouse support), while the server can be optimized for the processing and storage of data (for example, by having large amounts of memory and disk space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In networked environments, you can use inexpensive client workstations to access the remote data of the server effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database can be <span class="bold">scaled</span> as your system grows. You can add multiple servers to distribute the database processing load throughout the network (<span class="bold">horizontally scaled</span>), or you can move the database to a minicomputer or mainframe to take advantage of a larger system's performance (<span class="bold">vertically scaled</span>). In either case, data and applications are maintained with little or no modification because Oracle Database is portable between systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In networked environments, shared data is stored on the servers rather than on all computers, making it easier and more efficient to manage concurrent access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In networked environments, client applications submit database requests to the server using SQL statements. After it is received, each SQL statement is processed by the server, which returns results to the client. Network traffic is minimized because only the requests and the results are shipped over the network.</p>
</li>

<h3 class="sect2">Overview of Multitier Architecture</h3>
<p>In a traditional multitier architecture environment, an application server provides data for clients and serves as an interface between clients and database servers. This architecture enables use of an application server to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Validate the credentials of a client, such as a Web browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect to a database server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the requested operation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a multitier architecture appears in <a href="#i5360">Figure 16-3</a>.</p>

<div id="CNCPT1268" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3">Clients</h4>
<p>A client initiates a request for an operation to be performed on the database server. The client can be a Web browser or other end-user program. In a multitier architecture, the client connects to the database server through one or more application servers.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="BHCEICDH"></a>
<div id="CNCPT1269" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3">Application Servers</h4>
<p>An application server provides access to the data for the client. It serves as an interface between the client and one or more database servers, and hosts the applications.</p>
<p>An application server permits <span class="bold">thin clients</span>, which are clients equipped with minimal software configurations, to access applications without requiring ongoing maintenance of the client computers. The application server can also perform some data reformatting for the client, reducing the load on the client workstation.</p>
<p>The application server assumes the identity of the client when it is performing operations on the database server for that client. The privileges of the application server should be restricted to prevent it from performing unneeded and unwanted operations during a client operation.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="BHCCEAAA"></a>
<div id="CNCPT1270" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3">Database Servers</h4>
<p>A database server provides the data requested by an application server on behalf of a client. The database performs all of the <a href="glossary.htm#CHDGABIG"><span class="xrefglossterm">query</span></a> processing.</p>
<p>The database server can <a id="sthref1952"></a>audit operations performed by the application server on behalf of clients and operations performed by the application server on its own behalf (see <a href="cmntopc.htm#BABIEFIB">"Monitoring"</a>). For example, a client operation can request information to display on the client, while an application server operation can request a connection to the database server.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="BHCFCBHF"></a>
<div id="CNCPT1271" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h4>
<p><a id="sthref1953"></a><a id="sthref1954"></a><a id="sthref1955"></a>The database can serve as a Web service provider in traditional multitier or <span class="bold">service-oriented architecture (SOA)</span> environments. SOA is a multitier architecture relying on <span class="bold">services</span> that support computer-to-computer interaction over a network. The services can be dynamically discovered and queried on available functions and calling sequences.</p>
<p>SOA services are usually implemented as Web services accessible through the HTTP protocol. They are based on XML standards such as WSDL and SOAP.</p>
<p>The Oracle Database Web service capability, which is implemented as part of XML DB, must be specifically enabled by the DBA. Applications can then accomplish the following through database Web services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit SQL or XQuery queries and receive results as XML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoke standalone <a href="glossary.htm#CBAIDJHG"><span class="xrefglossterm">PL/SQL</span></a> functions and receive results (see <a href="srvrside.htm#i18617">"PL/SQL Subprograms"</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoke PL/SQL package functions and receive results</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Database Web services provide a simple way to add Web services to an application environment without the need for an application server. However, invoking Web services through application servers such as Oracle Fusion Middleware offers security, scalability, UDDI registration, and reliable messaging in an SOA environment. However, because database Web services integrate easily with Oracle Fusion Middleware, they may be appropriate for optimizing SOA solutions.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Overview of Grid Architecture</h3>
<p>In an Oracle Database environment, <span class="bold">grid computing</span> is a computing architecture that effectively pools large numbers of servers and storage into a flexible, on-demand computing resource. Modular hardware and software components can be connected and rejoined on demand to meet the changing needs of businesses.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Overview of Oracle Networking Architecture</h2>
<p><a id="sthref1956"></a><a id="sthref1957"></a><a id="sthref1958"></a><a id="sthref1959"></a><span class="bold">Oracle Net Services</span> is a suite of networking components that provides enterprise-wide connectivity solutions in distributed, heterogeneous computing environments. Oracle Net Services enables a network session from an application to a database <a href="glossary.htm#CBAFGFCJ"><span class="xrefglossterm">instance</span></a> and a database instance to another database instance.</p>
<p>Oracle Net Services provides location transparency, centralized configuration and management, and quick installation and configuration. It also lets you maximize system resources and improve performance. The Oracle Database <a href="glossary.htm#CBAGDHDC"><span class="xrefglossterm">shared server</span></a> architecture increases the scalability of applications and the number of clients simultaneously connected to the database. The <span class="bold">Virtual Interface (VI)</span> protocol places most of the messaging burden on high-speed network hardware, freeing the CPU.</p>
<p>Oracle Net Services uses the communication protocols or application programmatic interfaces (APIs) supported by a wide range of networks to provide distributed database and distributed processing. After a network session is established, Oracle Net Services acts as a data courier for the client application and the database server, establishing and maintaining a connection and exchanging messages. Oracle Net Services can perform these tasks because it exists on each computer in the network.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">How Oracle Net Services Works</h3>
<p>Oracle Database protocols take SQL statements from the interface of the Oracle applications and package them for transmission to Oracle Database through a supported industry-standard higher level protocol or <a id="sthref1960"></a>API. Replies from Oracle Database are packaged through the same higher level communications mechanism. This work occurs independently of the network operating system.</p>
<p>Depending on the operating system that runs Oracle Database, the Oracle Net Services software of the database server could include the driver software and start an additional background process.</p>

<p><a id="sthref1961"></a><a id="sthref1962"></a><a id="sthref1963"></a><a id="sthref1964"></a>The <span class="bold">Oracle Net Listener</span>, also called the <span class="bold">listener</span>, is a server-side process that listens for incoming client connection requests and manages traffic to the database.<a id="sthref1965"></a><a id="sthref1966"></a><a id="sthref1967"></a><a id="sthref1968"></a><a id="sthref1969"></a><a id="sthref1970"></a> When a database instance starts, and at various times during its life, the instance contacts a listener and establishes a communication pathway to this instance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Service registration</span> enables the listener to determine whether a database service and its service handlers are available. A <span class="bold">service handle</span>r is a dedicated <a href="glossary.htm#CBADBJJJ"><span class="xrefglossterm">server process</span></a> or dispatcher that acts as a connection point to a database.

This information enables the listener to start a service handler when a client request arrives.</p>
<p><a href="#CHDIBHAD">Figure 16-4</a> shows two databases, each on a separate host. The database environment is serviced by two listeners, each on a separate host. The PMON process running in each database instance communicates with both listeners to register the database.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A <a href="glossary.htm#CBADEIIA"><span class="xrefglossterm">client process</span></a> or another database requests a connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The listener selects an appropriate service handler to service the client request and forwards the request to the handler.</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Service Names</h4>
<p>In the context of net services, a <span class="bold">service</span> is a set of one or more database instances. A <span class="bold">service name</span> is a logical representation of a service used for client connections.</p>
<p>When a client connects to a listener, it requests a connection to a service. When a database instance starts, it registers itself with a listener as providing one or more services by name. Thus, the listener acts as a mediator between the client and instances and routes the connection request to the right place.</p>
<p>A single service, as known by a listener, can identify one or more database instances. Also, a single database instance can register one or more services with a listener. Clients connecting to a service need not specify which instance they require.</p>
<p><a href="#CHDFGAED">Figure 16-5</a> shows one single-instance database associated with two services, <code dir="ltr">book.example.com</code> and <code dir="ltr">soft.example.com</code>. The services enable the same database to be identified differently by different clients. A database administrator can limit or reserve system resources, permitting better resource allocation to clients requesting one of these services.</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Service Registration</h4>
<p><span class="bold">Service registration</span> is a feature by which the PMON process dynamically registers instance information with a listener, which enables the listener to forward client connection requests to the appropriate service handler. PMON provides the listener with information about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Names of the database services provided by the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name of the database instance associated with the services and its current and maximum load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service handlers (dispatchers and dedicated servers) available for the instance, including their type, protocol addresses, and current and maximum load</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Service registration is dynamic and does not require configuration in the <code dir="ltr">listener</code>.<code dir="ltr">ora</code> file. Dynamic registration reduces administrative overhead for multiple databases or instances.</p>
<p><a id="sthref1975"></a><a id="sthref1976"></a>The initialization parameter <code dir="ltr">SERVICE_NAMES</code> lists the services an instance belongs to. On startup, each instance registers with the listeners of other instances belonging to the same services. During database operations, the instances of each service pass information about CPU use and current connection counts to all listeners in the same services. This communication enables dynamic load balancing and connection failover.<a id="sthref1977"></a></p>

<h3 class="sect2">Dedicated Server Architecture</h3>
<p>In a <span class="bold">dedicated server architecture</span>, the server process created on behalf of each client process is called a <span class="bold">dedicated server process</span> (or <span class="bold">shadow</span> process). This server process is separate from the client process and acts only on its behalf, as shown in <a href="#CHDEECGC">Figure 16-6</a>.</p>

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>A one-to-one ratio exists between the client processes and server processes. Even when the user is not actively making a database request, the dedicated server process remains&mdash;although it is inactive and can be paged out on some operating systems.</p>
<p><a href="#CHDEECGC">Figure 16-6</a> shows user and server processes running on networked computers. However, the dedicated server architecture is also used if the same computer runs both the client application and the database code but the host operating system could not maintain the separation of the two programs if they were run in a single process. Linux is an example of such an operating system.</p>
<p><a id="i16597"></a>In the dedicated server architecture, the user and server processes communicate using different mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the client process and the dedicated server process run on the same computer, then the program interface uses the host operating system's interprocess communication mechanism to perform its job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client process and the dedicated server process run on different computers, then the program interface provides the communication mechanisms (such as the network software and Oracle Net Services) between the programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Underutilized dedicated servers sometimes result in inefficient use of operating system resources. Consider an order entry system with dedicated server processes. A customer places an order as a clerk enters the order into the database. For most of the transaction, the clerk is talking to the customer while the server process dedicated to the clerk's client process is idle. The server process is not needed during most of the transaction, and the system may be slower for other clerks entering orders if the system is managing too many processes. For applications of this type, the shared server architecture may be preferable.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Shared Server Architecture</h3>
<p>In a <span class="bold">shared server architecture</span>, a dispatcher directs multiple incoming network session requests to a pool of shared server processes, eliminating the need for a dedicated server process for each connection. An idle shared server process from the pool picks up a request from a common queue.</p>
<p>The potential benefits of shared server are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduces the number of processes on the operating system</p>
<p>A small number of shared servers can perform the same amount of processing as many dedicated servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces instance PGA memory</p>
<p>Every dedicated or shared server has a PGA. Fewer server processes means fewer PGAs and less process management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases application scalability and the number of clients that can simultaneously connect to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May be faster than dedicated server when the rate of client connections and disconnections is high</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="sthref1979"></a><a id="sthref1980"></a><a id="sthref1981"></a><a id="sthref1982"></a>Shared server has several disadvantages, including slower response time in some cases, incomplete feature support, and increased complexity for setup and tuning. As a general guideline, only use shared server when you have more concurrent connections to the database than the operating system can handle.</p>
<p>The following processes are needed in a shared server architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A network listener that connects the client processes to dispatchers or dedicated servers (the listener is part of Oracle Net Services, not Oracle Database)</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
<a id="sthref1983"></a>To use shared servers, a client process must connect through Oracle Net Services, even if the process runs on the same computer as the Oracle Database instance.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>One or more <a href="glossary.htm#CHDCDAGF"><span class="xrefglossterm">dispatcher process (D<span class="italic">nnn</span>)</span></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One or more shared server processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a database can support both shared server and dedicated server connections simultaneously. For example, one client can connect using a dedicated server while a different client connects to the same database using a shared server.</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Dispatcher Request and Response Queues</h4>
<p><a id="sthref1984"></a><a id="sthref1985"></a><a id="sthref1986"></a>A request from a user is a single API call that is part of the user's SQL statement. When a user makes a call, the following actions occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The dispatcher places the request on the <span class="bold">request queue</span>, where it is picked up by the next available shared server process.</p>
<p>The request queue is in the SGA and is common to all dispatcher processes of an instance (see <a href="memory.htm#BGBGHJAA">"Large Pool"</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shared server processes check the common request queue for new requests, picking up new requests on a first-in-first-out basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One shared server process picks up one request in the queue and makes all necessary calls to the database to complete this request.</p>
<p>A different server process can handle each database call. Therefore, requests to parse a query, fetch the first row, fetch the next row, and close the result set may each be processed by a different shared server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the server process completes the request, it places the response on the calling dispatcher's <span class="bold">response queue</span>. Each dispatcher has its own response queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dispatcher returns the completed request to the appropriate client process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, in an order entry system, each clerk's client process connects to a dispatcher. Each request made by the clerk is sent to this dispatcher, which places the request in the queue. The next available shared server picks up the request, services it, and puts the response in the response queue. When a request is completed, the clerk remains connected to the dispatcher, but the shared server that processed the request is released and available for other requests. While one clerk talks to a customer, another clerk can use the same shared server process.</p>
<p><a href="#BEIDDFDG">Figure 16-7</a> shows how client processes communicate with the dispatcher across the API and how the dispatcher communicates user requests to shared server processes.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><a id="sthref1997"></a><a id="sthref1998"></a><a id="sthref1999"></a>When an instance starts, the network listener process opens and establishes a communication pathway through which users connect to Oracle Database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each dispatcher process gives the listener process an address at which the dispatcher listens for connection requests.</p>
<p>At least one dispatcher process must be configured and started for each network protocol that the database clients will use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a client process makes a connection request, the listener determines whether the client process should use a shared server process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the listener determines that a shared server process is required, then the listener returns the address of the dispatcher process that has the lightest load, and the client process connects to the dispatcher directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the process cannot communicate with the dispatcher, or if the client process requests a dedicated server, then the listener creates a dedicated server and establishes an appropriate connection.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Database Resident Connection Pooling</h3>
<p><a id="sthref2016"></a><span class="bold">Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)</span> provides a connection pool of dedicated servers for typical Web application scenarios. A Web application typically makes a database connection, uses the connection briefly, and then releases it. Through DRCP, the database can scale to tens of thousands of simultaneous connections.</p>
<p>DRCP provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complements middle-tier connection pools that share connections between threads in a middle-tier process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables database connections to be shared across multiple middle-tier processes. These middle-tier processes may belong to the same or different middle-tier host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables a significant reduction in key database resources required to support many client connections. For example, DRCP reduces the memory required for the database and boosts the scalability of the database and middle tier. The pool of available servers also reduces the cost of re-creating client connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides pooling for architectures with multi-process, single-threaded application servers, such as PHP and Apache, that cannot do middle-tier connection pooling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DRCP uses a <span class="bold">pooled server</span>, which is the equivalent of a dedicated server process (not a shared server process) and a database session combined. The pooled server model avoids the overhead of dedicating a server for every connection that requires the server for a short period.</p>
<p>Clients obtaining connections from the database resident connection pool connect to an Oracle background process known as the <span class="bold">connection broker</span>. The connection broker implements the pool functionality and multiplexes pooled servers among inbound connections from client processes.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#CHDHGCAC">Figure 16-8</a>, when a client requires database access, the connection broker picks up a server process from the pool and hands it off to the client. The client is directly connected to the server process until the request is served. After the server has finished, the server process is released into the pool. The connection from the client is restored to the broker.</p>

<p class="titleinfigure"><a id="CHDHGCAC"></a>Figure 16-8 DRCP</p>

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>In DRCP, releasing resources leaves the session intact, but no longer associated with a connection (server process). Unlike in shared server, this session stores its UGA in the PGA, not in the SGA. A client can reestablish a connection transparently upon detecting activity.</p>
