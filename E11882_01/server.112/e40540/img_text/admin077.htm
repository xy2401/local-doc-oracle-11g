<p>This figure shows the directory structure of the ADR for a single database instance, where each directory is represented by a folder. At the top is a folder labeled as "ADR base". Beneath ADR base is a directory named diag, beneath which is a directory named rdbms. Beneath the rdbms directory is a directory whose name is the database name. Beneath that directory is a directory whole name is the database SID. This directory is flagged by a label as the ADR home for the database instance. Beneath the ADR home directory (the directory whose name is the database SID) are the following subdirectories: alert, cdump, incident, trace, and one named "(others)", which indicates several other ADR home subdirectories.</p>
