<p>This graphic shows a shared pool check. At the top are three boxes laid on top of one another, each box smaller than the one behind it. The smallest box shows hash values and is labeled Shared SQL Area. The second box is labeled Shared Pool. The outer box is labeled SGA. Below this box is another box labeled PGA. Within the PGA box is a box labeled Private SQL Area, which contains a hash value. A double-ended arrow connects the upper and lower boxes and is labeled "Comparison of hash values." To the right of the PGA box is a person icon labeled User Process. The icons are connected by a double-sided arrow. Above the User Process icon is an "Update ...." statement. An arrow leads from the User Process below so the Server Process icon below.</p>
