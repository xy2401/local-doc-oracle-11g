<p>The graphic is divided into two boxes with dotted borders, one on top of the other. The top is labeled "Branch Blocks" and the lower "Leaf Blocks." The graphic contains a tree of boxes. At the top is a box with the following values: 0..60, 81..100, 101.160, and so on. Three arrows point to a second row of branch blocks. One block in this row has values 0..30 and 31..60. An adjacent block has values 61..68, 69..73, and so on. The last block has values 200..220, 221..230, and so on.</p>
<p>The leftmost and rightmost blocks each has a pair of arrows pointing down. The leftmost arrow points to a leaf block containing the following values: "20,Marketing,201,1800" and "30,Purchasing,114,1700". The block to the right contains the following values: "50,Shipping,121,1500" and "60,IT,103,1400". The next block contains values: "200,Operations,,1700", "210,IT Support,,1700", and "220,NOC,1700". The rightmost block contains the following values: "260,Recruiting,,1700" and "270,Payroll,,1700". With the exception of the leftmost and rightmost block, each of the leaf blocks in the bottom row is linked by a double-headed arrow to the block on either side.</p>
