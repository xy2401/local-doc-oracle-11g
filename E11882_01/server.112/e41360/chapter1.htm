<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">4.1</span> Application Development</h2>
<p>The following sections describe the new application development features for Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> Release 2 (11.2).</p>
<a id="OBJECTIVENO00001"></a>
<div id="NEWFT109" class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">4.1.1</span> Oracle Application Express</h3>
<p>The following sections describe Oracle Application Express features.</p>
<a id="FEATURENO08814"></a>
<div id="NEWFT110" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.1</span> Application Date Format</h4>
<p>You can now define a date format to be used throughout an application. This date format is used to alter the <code dir="ltr">NLS_DATE_FORMAT</code> database session setting prior to showing or submitting any page within the application. This format is used by all reports showing dates and is also picked up by form items of type "Date Picker (use Application Date Format)".</p>
<p>The ability to specify a date format at the application level ensures consistency across the application. Therefore, whenever dates are displayed or input, they are in the same format.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08808"></a>
<div id="NEWFT111" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.2</span> Custom Themes</h4>
<p>In addition to the default themes provided with Oracle Application Express, you can create your own customized themes. You can either start with one of the twenty standard themes available with Oracle Application Express and modify the underlying templates or define your own templates from scratch. Each theme consists of a set of templates defined with cascading style sheets (CSS) and HTML.</p>
<p>The ability to publish custom themes enables you to design a specific look and feel to meet your corporate requirements and then publish them as a theme for all other applications to use.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08813"></a>
<div id="NEWFT112" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.3</span> Declarative BLOB Support</h4>
<p>Declarative BLOB support enables files to be declaratively uploaded in forms, and downloaded or displayed using reports. BLOB display and download can also be authored procedurally using PL/SQL.</p>
<p>The storing of binary large objects (BLOBs) within the database is growing in popularity due to the many advantages over storing content on disparate file systems. By incorporating declarative support for managing BLOBs into Application Express, the loading and manipulating of content is greatly simplified.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08809"></a>
<div id="NEWFT113" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.4</span> Documented JavaScript Libraries</h4>
<p>This release includes an improved framework for advanced Oracle Application Express developers to build and leverage custom Web 2.0 capabilities, improving performance and enabling developers to create more dynamic application widgets. Oracle Application Express also includes the ability to suppress standard JavaScript and CSS files. All included JavaScript files are now compressed to improve page load time.</p>
<p>Many developers want to extend their applications to include additional Web 2.0 capabilities or to minimize the page weight for use on mobile devices such as iphones and smartphones. The documentation and declarative capabilities allow developers to design applications for these disparate requirements.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08811"></a>
<div id="NEWFT114" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.5</span> Enhanced Report Printing</h4>
<p>Release 3.1 includes XML as a download format and supports multiple SQL statements.</p>
<p>Oracle Application Express interactive reporting provides the ability to manipulate the way in which the data is displayed on the screen. Users can also download this data in various formats including PDF, RTF, XLS and now XML.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08806"></a>
<div id="NEWFT115" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.6</span> Forms Conversion</h4>
<p>Forms Conversion captures the design of existing Oracle Forms and automatically converts some components, primarily the user interface. Other components, such as complex triggers, need to be manually converted post-generation.</p>
<p>Moving to native HTML is not seamless and changes to the user interface are required to deliver optimal Web interactivity.</p>
<p>The Oracle Application Express Forms Conversion enables you to take advantage of Oracle Application Express dynamic HTML capabilities, including interactive reports. Given the similarities between Oracle Forms and Oracle Application Express development (both use SQL and PL/SQL), retraining requirements are also low.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08810"></a>
<div id="NEWFT116" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.7</span> Improved Security</h4>
<p>Oracle Application Express offers a number of security enhancements. Key enhancements include the ability to declaratively encrypt session state and specify session time outs for maximum idle time and maximum session duration as well as create new password item types that enable users to enter passwords without ever saving them to session state.</p>
<p>Other features include reducing the privileges required by the Oracle Application Express database account, disabling database monitoring by default, and the ability to specify HTTPS for administration. In addition, administrators can now restrict password reuse. This release also includes a new Hidden and Protected item type. This item type greatly simplifies the developer's task of protecting item session state. This, together with other minor improvements, makes the default security functionality more robust within Oracle Application Express.</p>
<p>The additional declarative security capabilities make it easier for developers and administrators to harden the security of their applications and the development environment. These new capabilities complement existing Oracle Application Express security features some of which include flexible authentication, authorization schemes, and URL tampering protection.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08805"></a>
<div id="NEWFT117" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.8</span> Interactive Reporting Region</h4>
<p>Interactive Reporting Regions enable end users to customize reports. Users can alter the layout of report data by choosing the columns they are interested in, applying filters, highlighting, and sorting. They can also define breaks, aggregations, different charts, and their own computations. Users can create multiple variations of the report and save them as named reports and download to various file formats including comma-delimited file (CSV) format, Microsoft Excel (XLS) format, Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), and Microsoft Word Rich Text Format (RTF).</p>
<p>Oracle Application Express Interactive Reporting enables developers to quickly develop reports that can be manipulated by end users to meet a wide range of reporting requirements. Therefore, instead of developers having to define specific report layouts for different users or groups, they can define a common report that can be used to meet the majority of the different requirements.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08807"></a>
<div id="NEWFT118" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.1.9</span> Runtime-Only Installation</h4>
<p>For testing and production instances, Oracle Application Express now supports the ability to install a runtime version of Oracle Application Express. This minimizes the installed footprint and privileges. Scripts are also provided to remove or add the developer interface from an existing instance.</p>
<p>The ability to implement a runtime-only environment improves application security as developers cannot inadvertently or maliciously update a production application.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">4.2</span> Availability</h2>
<p>The focus of this Availability section is aimed towards providing capabilities that keep the Oracle database available for continuous data access, despite unplanned failures and scheduled maintenance activities. These various capabilities form the basis of Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA), which is the Oracle blueprint for implementing a highly available infrastructure using integrated Oracle technologies.</p>
<a id="OBJECTIVENO00003"></a>
<div id="NEWFT127" class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">4.2.1</span> Backup and Recovery</h3>
<p>The following sections describe new features in this release that provide improvements in the area of backup and recovery.</p>
<a id="FEATURENO08777"></a>
<div id="NEWFT128" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.1.1</span> Automatic Block Repair</h4>
<p>Automatic block repair allows corrupt blocks on the primary database or physical standby database to be automatically repaired, as soon as they are detected, by transferring good blocks from the other destination. In addition, <code dir="ltr">RECOVER BLOCK</code> is enhanced to restore blocks from a physical standby database. The physical standby database must be in real-time query mode.</p>
<p>This feature reduces time when production data cannot be accessed, due to block corruption, by automatically repairing the corruptions as soon as they are detected in real-time using good blocks from a physical standby database. This reduces block recovery time by using up-to-date good blocks from a real-time, synchronized physical standby database as opposed to disk or tape backups or flashback logs.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.1.3</span> DUPLICATE Without Connection to Target Database</h4>
<p><code dir="ltr">DUPLICATE</code> can be performed without connecting to a target database. This requires connecting to a catalog and auxiliary database.</p>
<p>The benefit is improved availability of a <code dir="ltr">DUPLICATE</code> operation by not requiring connection to a target database. This is particularly useful for <code dir="ltr">DUPLICATE</code> to a destination database where connection to the target database may not be available at all times.</p>

<div id="NEWFT131" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.1.4</span> Enhanced Tablespace Point-In-Time Recovery (TSPITR)</h4>
<p>Tablespace point-in-time recovery (TSPITR) is enhanced as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You now have the ability to recover a dropped tablespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TSPITR can be repeated multiple times for the same tablespace. Previously, once a tablespace had been recovered to an earlier point-in-time, it could not be recovered to another earlier point-in-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">DBMS_TTS.TRANSPORT_SET_CHECK</code> is automatically run to ensure that TSPITR is successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">AUXNAME</code> is no longer used for recovery set data files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature improves usability with TSPITR.</p>

<a id="FEATURENO08780"></a>
<div id="NEWFT132" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.1.5</span> New DUPLICATE Options</h4>
<p>The following are new options for the <code dir="ltr">DUPLICATE</code> command:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">NOREDO</code></p>
<p><code dir="ltr">NOREDO</code> indicates that archive logs are not applied. Because targetless DUPLICATE does not connect to the target database, it cannot check if the database is running in <code dir="ltr">NOARCHIVELOG</code> mode. It can also be used during regular duplication to force a database currently in <code dir="ltr">ARCHIVELOG</code> mode to be recovered without applying archive logs (for example, because it was in <code dir="ltr">NOARCHIVELOG</code> mode at the point-in-time it is being duplicated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">UNDO TABLESPACE &lt;</code><code dir="ltr"><span class="codeinlineitalic">tsname</span></code><code dir="ltr">&gt; [ , &lt;</code><code dir="ltr"><span class="codeinlineitalic">tsname</span></code><code dir="ltr">&gt; ... ]</code></p>
<p>When not connected to a recovery catalog and not connected to an open target database, RMAN cannot obtain the list of tablespaces with undo segments, therefore, you must specify them with this clause.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature improves the usability of the DUPLICATE command.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="FEATURENO08778"></a>
<div id="NEWFT133" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.1.6</span> New SET NEWNAME Clauses and Format Options</h4>
<p>The following are new clauses and format options for the <code dir="ltr">SET NEWNAME</code> command:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single <code dir="ltr">SET NEWNAME</code> command can be applied to all files in a tablespace, or for all files in the database. For example:</p>
<pre dir="ltr">
SET NEWNAME FOR TABLESPACE &lt;<span class="italic">tsname</span>&gt; TO &lt;<span class="italic">format</span>&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Or,</p>
<pre dir="ltr">
SET NEWNAME FOR DATABASE TO &lt;<span class="italic">format</span>&gt;;
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>New format identifiers for <code dir="ltr">SET NEWNAME...&lt;</code><code dir="ltr"><span class="codeinlineitalic">format</span></code><code dir="ltr">&gt;</code> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">%U</code></p>
<p>Unique identifier. <code dir="ltr">data_D-%d_I-%I_TS-%N_FNO-%f</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code dir="ltr">%b</code></p>
<p>UNIX base name of the original data file name. For example, if the original data file name was <code dir="ltr">ORACLE_HOME/data/tbs_01.f</code>, then <code dir="ltr">%b</code> is <code dir="ltr">tbs_01.f</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is improved flexibility of <code dir="ltr">RESTORE</code>, <code dir="ltr">DUPLICATE</code>, and TSPITR.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.2.2.1</span> Edition-based Redefinition</h4>
<p>Edition-based redefinition allows an application's database objects to be changed without interrupting the application's availability by making the changes in the privacy of a new edition. Every database has at least one edition. The DBA creates a new edition as a child of the existing one. The changes are made in the child edition while you continue to use the parent edition. When needed, changes to data are made safely by writing only to new columns or new tables not seen by the old edition. Editioning views expose a different projection of each changed table into each edition to allow each to see just its own columns. Crossedition triggers propagate data changes made by the old edition into the columns of the new edition. When the installation of the changes is complete, some users start to use the new edition while others drain off the old edition. Here, crossedition triggers propagate data changes made by the new edition into the columns of the old edition.</p>
<p>Large, mission critical applications are often unavailable for long periods of time while database objects are patched or upgraded. Edition-based redefinition allows this cost to be avoided.</p>

The access parameters can specify the name of a directory object and the name of an executable file in that directory object.

The output from the program is passed into the access driver which parses the data into records and columns.</p>
<p>The initial use of this feature is by a customer who needs to load data that is stored in compressed files. The user specifies the name of the program used to decompress the file as part of the access parameters. The access driver reads the output of the decompression program.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.3.4.1</span> In-Memory Parallel Execution</h4>
<p>Traditionally, parallel execution has enabled organizations to manage and access large amounts of data by taking full advantage of the I/O capacity of the system. In-memory parallel execution harnesses the aggregated memory in a system to enhance query performance by minimizing or even completely eliminating the physical I/O needed for a parallel operation. Oracle automatically decides if an object being accessed using parallel execution benefits from being cached in the SGA (buffer cache). The decision to cache an object is based on a well defined set of heuristics including size of the object and the frequency that it is accessed. In an Oracle RAC environment, Oracle maps fragments of the object into each of the buffer caches on the active instances. By creating this mapping, Oracle knows which buffer cache to access to find a specific part or partition of an object to answer a given SQL query.</p>
<p>In-memory parallel query harnesses the aggregated memory in a system for parallel operations, enabling it to scale out with the available memory for data caching as the number of nodes in a cluster increases. This new functionality optimizes large parallel operations by minimizing or even completely eliminating the physical I/O needed because the parallel operation can now be satisfied in memory.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.3.4.3</span> The DBMS_PARALLEL_EXECUTE Package</h4>
<p>The <code dir="ltr">DBMS_PARALLEL_EXECUTE</code> package provides subprograms to allow a specified <code dir="ltr">INSERT</code>, <code dir="ltr">UPDATE</code>, <code dir="ltr">DELETE</code>, <code dir="ltr">MERGE</code>, or anonymous block statement to be applied in parallel chunks. The statement must have two placeholders that define the start and end limit of a chunk. Typically, these are values for the rowid or a surrogate unique key in a large table. But, when an anonymous block is used, the block can interpret the values arbitrarily. The package has subprograms to define ranges that cover the specified table. These include rule-based division of a table's rowid or key range and support user-defined methods. The SQL statement together with the set of chunk ranges define a task. Another subprogram starts the task. Each task is processed using a scheduler job and automatically commits when it completes. Progress is logged. Untried, successful, and failed chunks are flagged as such on task completion or interruption. Another subprogram allows the task to resume to try untried and failed chunks.</p>
<p>Many scenarios require the bulk transformation of a large number of rows. Using an ordinary SQL statement suffers from the all-or-nothing effect. In the common case, where the transformation of one row is independent of that of other rows, it is correct to commit every row that is transformed successfully and to roll back every row where the transformation fails. Some customers have implemented schemes to achieve this from scratch, using the Oracle Scheduler and suitable methods to record progress. This package provides a supported solution and adds database-wide manageability through new catalog views for parallel task metadata. The package is especially useful in online application upgrade scenarios to apply a crossedition trigger to all the rows in the table on which it is defined.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">4.10.1</span> Automatic Storage Management for All Data</h3>
<p>These features extend the capabilities of Automatic Storage Management (ASM) to support all types of data including database files, clusterware files, and file system data such as Oracle homes and binaries.</p>
<p>The following sections describe ASM features.</p>
<a id="FEATURENO07050"></a>
<div id="NEWFT250" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.10.1.1</span> ASM Cluster File System (ACFS)</h4>
<p>The ASM Cluster File System (ACFS) extends Automatic Storage Management (ASM) by providing a robust, modern, general purpose file system for files beyond the Oracle database files. ACFS provides support for files such as Oracle binaries, report files, trace files, alert logs, and other application data files. With the addition of the Oracle ASM Cluster File System, ASM becomes a complete storage management solution for both Oracle database and non-database files.</p>
<p>ACFS supports large files with 64-bit file and file system data structure sizes leading to exabyte-capable file and file system capacities. ACFS scales to hundreds of nodes and uses extent-based storage allocation for improved performance. A log-based metadata transaction engine is used for file system integrity and fast recovery. The ACFS on-disk structure supports endian neutral metadata. ACFS file systems can be exported to remote clients through industry standard protocols such as NFS and CIFS.</p>
<p>Oracle ASM Cluster File System (ACFS) complements and leverages Automatic Storage Management (ASM) and provides a general purpose journaling file system for storing and managing non-Oracle database files. This eliminates the need for expensive third-party cluster file system solutions while streamlining, automating and simplifying all file type management in a single node as well as Oracle RAC and Oracle Grid infrastructure for a cluster computing environments.</p>
<p>ACFS supports dynamic file system expansion and contraction without any downtime. ACFS is highly available leveraging the ASM mirroring and striping features in addition to hardware Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) functionality.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.10.1.2</span> ASM Dynamic Volume Manager (DVM)</h4>
<p>The ASM Dynamic Volume Manager (DVM) is a kernel-loadable device driver that provides a standard device driver interface to clients (for example, ACFS). File systems or other processes can do I/O to this device driver as they would to any other disk device driver on the system. DVM is the primary I/O interface for ACFS to perform I/O and build a file system leveraging ASM as a volume manager. DVM is loaded on ASM start up. The device driver is cluster-aware and communicates with ASM for extent map information, extent rebalancing, and I/O failures.</p>
<p>The ASM Dynamic Volume Manager (DVM) provides a standard I/O interface allowing general purpose file systems to leverage the full functionality of ASM as a volume manager. Oracle database files as well as non-Oracle database files, for example Oracle binaries, can now reside on ACFS eliminating the need for third-party file systems or volume managers to host general purpose files.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.10.1.3</span> ASM FS Snapshot</h4>
<p>ASM FS Snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a file system and can provide up to 64 snapshot images. ASM FS Snapshot performs fast creation of persistent ASM FS images at a specific point-in-time with low overhead leveraging the Copy on Write technology.</p>
<p>Read-only ASM FS Snapshots can be generated on an interval basis. They may reside in existing ASM FS storage or in an additional storage device and persist following a system restart.</p>
<p>Even as the file system changes, the snapshot does not, giving you the ability to view the file system as it was at the time the snapshot was created. Initially, snapshots are read-only, which preserves their point-in-time capture. The following are the benefits of ASM FS Snapshots:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ASM FS Snapshots can be used as a source for backup. The original file system can continue to change but the static nature of the snapshot makes them ideal as a source for backup without keeping the original file system offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASM FS Snapshots can be used as a means for you to recover accidentally deleted or modified files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASM FS Snapshots can be used as a source for data mining or report applications which need to work on a static, point-in-time data set.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.10.1.4</span> Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) and Voting Disk on ASM</h4>
<p>Automatic Storage Management (ASM) disks are used to store the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) and the voting disks. ASM Partnership and Status Table (PST) is replicated on multiple disks and is extended to store the OCR. Consequently, the OCR tolerates loss of the same number of disks as the underlying disk group. OCR is relocated in response to disk failures.</p>
<p>ASM reserves a number of blocks at a fixed location of every ASM disk for storing the voting disk. Should the disk holding the voting disk fail, ASM selects another disk to store this data.</p>
<p>Storing the OCR and the voting disk on ASM eliminates the need to use expensive third-party cluster volume managers or deal with the complexity of managing disk partitions for OCR and voting disks in Oracle RAC configurations.</p>

<p>Disk drives have higher transfer rates and bytes per track on the outer tracks. This makes it preferable to keep the hotter data closer to the edge of the disk; that is, the lower numbered blocks. This feature enables ASM to identify higher performance disk regions. Most frequently accessed ASM files can be marked to be moved into the hot region and take advantage of higher I/O performance (for example, hot tablespaces and indices) and able to better meet the application I/O demand. This feature is only applicable when whole physical disks are presented to ASM versus local unit numbers (LUN).</p>
<p>Most frequently accessed Oracle database files in ASM disk groups (ASM files) can be placed in hot disk regions to deliver higher bandwidth and reduce seek latency to meet the application I/O performance requirements.</p>

<p>Automatic Storage Management (ASM) on UNIX platforms implements access control on its files to isolate different database instances from each other and prevent unauthorized access. ASM implements new SQL statements to grant, modify, and deny file permissions. The new security model and syntax is coherent with those already implemented for the objects represented in Oracle Database.</p>
<p>Multiple database instances can store ASM files in the same disk group and, therefore, are able to consolidate multiple databases with security. This prevents unauthorized database instances from accessing or overwriting each other's files.</p>

<p>This release includes the following enhancements to SQL Tuning Advisor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQL Tuning Advisor may recommend accepting a profile that uses the Automatic Degree of Parallelism (Auto DOP) feature. A parallel query profile is only recommended when the original plan is serial and when parallel execution can significantly reduce the elapsed time for a long-running query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tuning a SQL statement, SQL Tuning Advisor searches real-time and historical performance data for alternative execution plans for the statement. If plans other than the original plan exist, then SQL Tuning Advisor reports an alternative plan finding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can transport a SQL tuning set to any database created in Oracle Database 10<span class="italic">g</span> (Release 2) or later. This technique is useful when using SQL Performance Analyzer to tune regressions on a test database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features are introduced to enhance the capabilities of the SQL Tuning Advisor. The newest version can recommend alternative plans that were seen at some time in the past, in case they perform better, as well as recommending queries to run in parallel if that is beneficial for the total runtime of each query.</p>
<p>The STS export to old releases is designed to help customers with upgrades so that they are using the most recent version of the database software.</p>

<div id="NEWFT290" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.11.3.1</span> Database File System (DBFS)</h4>
<p>The Oracle Database File System (DBFS) enables the database to be used as a POSIX-compatible file system on Linux. This feature includes a PL/SQL package on the database server that enables the DBFS server functionality and a Linux client for DBFS (<code dir="ltr">dbfs_client</code>). The <code dir="ltr">dbfs_client</code> client is a utility that enables mounting of a DBFS file system as a mount point on Linux. It provides the mapping from file system operations to database operations. The dbfs_client client runs completely in user space and interacts with the kernel through the FUSE library infrastructure.</p>
<p>DBFS Hierarchical Store provides an easy and application-transparent way to archive SecureFiles data that is stored in DBFS file systems to secondary storage tiers such as tape and storage clouds, using DBFS Links. It also allows archived data to be dearchived and brought back into the database on demand.</p>
<p>DBFS makes it easy for files to be accessed by database applications, and for file-based tools to access files stored in the database. With DBFS, all important file data can be seamlessly stored in an Oracle database, providing the benefits of security, backup, performance, and scalability that are standard with the Oracle Database.</p>
<p>SecureFiles is a high performance solution for storing files or unstructured data in Oracle Database. Customers often need to store these files for long periods of time for business or compliance reasons. Consequently, customers are looking to transfer files to cheaper forms of storage in an application-transparent manner to reduce manageability and administration overhead. DBFS Hierarchical Store provides a seamless, automatic, and transparent way to archive cold file data to inexpensive storage.</p>

This compression level introduces a lightweight compression option that removes the majority of the CPU cost that is typical with file compression. Compressed SecureFiles at the <code dir="ltr">LOW</code> level now provides a very efficient choice for SecureFiles storage. SecureFiles LOBs compressed at <code dir="ltr">LOW</code> generally consume less CPU than BasicFile (pre-11g Release 1) LOBs, consume less storage than BasicFile LOBs and typically makes the application run faster because of reduced disk I/O.</p>
