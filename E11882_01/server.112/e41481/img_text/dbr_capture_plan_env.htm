<p>On the right of the page, the following text appears: Step 1 of 6. The Back button is to the left of the text, and the Next and Cancel buttons are to the right of the text.</p>
<p>The following text appears:</p>
<p>The following prerequisites should be met to avoid potential problems before proceeding to capture the workload.</p>
<p>Two check boxes with text follow:</p>
<p>The first check box has the following text: Make sure there is enough disk space to hold the captured workload. Consider doing a short duration workload capture and using it for estimating the disk space requirement of a full workload capture.</p>
<p>The second check box has the following text: Make sure you can restore the replay database to match the capture database at the start of the workload capture. A successful workload replay depends on application transactions accessing application data identical to that on a capture system. Common ways to restore application data state include point-in-time recovery, flashback, and import/export.</p>
