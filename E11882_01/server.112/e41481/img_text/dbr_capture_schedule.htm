<p>On the right of the page, the following text appears: Step 5 of 6. The Back button appears to the left of the text, and the Next and Cancel buttons appear to the right of the text.</p>
<p>The following text appears: "Schedule start time and duration for capture."</p>
<p>Next to Start, the following options are listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Immediately (selected)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later (a field follows to specify the time)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next to Duration, the following options are listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indefinitely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For (selected. Drop-downs follow to select the number of hours and minutes, and an Until field appears to specify the cut-off time for execution.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the Automatic Workload Repository section, the following text appears:</p>
<p>"Exporting of AWR data during capture enables performance comparison of the database between capture and replay. Because AWR data exportation can have a significant impact on the production system, it should be scheduled at a time that will not negatively impact the production system. Selecting "Immediately" will schedule AWR data to be exported immediately after capture is complete (as scheduled in the subsequent Schedule step)."</p>
<p>Below this text are Start Immediately and Start Later radio buttons. The Later radio button has a field to input the time.</p>
