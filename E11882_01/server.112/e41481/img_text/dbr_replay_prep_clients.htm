<body>
<p>The heading Replay Workload: Prepare Replay Clients appears on the upper left portion of the page. Below the heading are values for Database, Replay Name, and Logged In As.</p>
<p>The upper right portion of the page states "Step 6 of 8," Cancel and Back buttons appear to the left of this text, and a Next button appears to the right of this text.</p>
<p>There are two tabs: Connection Mappings, and Replay Parameters, and the Connection Mappings tab is open.</p>
<p>The text at the top of this tab reads: "Replay Clients must establish connections to the replay database. Specify connector details to the replay database using either a single connector descriptor or net service name." A tip follows this that reads: "Connections must point to the replay database for a successful replay."</p>
<p>Below this text is a Capture Name drop-down with myCapture112 selected, and a Capture Database read-only field with Oemrep_Database appearing.</p>
<p>Below these are two radio buttons with the first one selected, and each radio button has user input fields. The first radio button has the following text: "Use a single connect descriptor for all client connections." A Test Connection button appears to the right of this text. The user input text is as follows:</p>
<p>(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=slc01xhi.us.oracle.com)(PORT=15045)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=tgc00)))</p>
<p>The second radio button has the following text: "Use a single TNS net service name for all client connections." The following tip text appears below the input field for this radio button: "All Replay Clients must be able to resolve the net service name (for example, through a local tnsnames.ora file)."</p>
